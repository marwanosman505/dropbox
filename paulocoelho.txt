PART ONE
THE BOY’S NAME WAS SANTIAGO. DUSK WAS FALLING AS the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once stood.
He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night. There were no wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend the entire next day searching for it.
He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would have to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable pillows.
It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars through the half-destroyed roof.
I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended.
He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still slept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them through the countryside in search of food and water. “They are so used to me that they know my schedule,” he muttered. Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it
could be the other way around: that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule.
But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy prodded them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by name. He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said. So there were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an impression on him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields. Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed.
But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the girl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only once, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the boy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.
“I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL,” THE BOY TOLD THE merchant.
The shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon. So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag.
“I didn’t know shepherds knew how to read,” said a girl’s voice behind him.
The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia, with flowing black hair, and eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors.
“Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books,” he answered. During the two hours that they talked, she told him she
was the merchant’s daughter, and spoke of life in the village, where each day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the Andalusian countryside, and related the news from the other towns where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep.
“How did you learn to read?” the girl asked at one point.
“Like everybody learns,” he said. “In school.”
“Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?”
The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question. He was sure the girl would never understand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her bright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise. As the time passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days. He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again.
But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep. He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year.
AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE back in that same village. He was excited, and at the same time uneasy: maybe the girl had already forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling their wool.
“It doesn’t matter,” he said to his sheep. “I know other girls in other places.”
But in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that shepherds, like seamen and like traveling salesmen, always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering.
The day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun. They never have to make any decisions, he thought. Maybe that’s why they always stay close to me.
The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives, and didn’t understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content with just food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of their wool, their company, and—once in a while—their meat.
If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one, they would become aware only after most of the flock had been slaughtered, thought the boy. They trust me, and they’ve forgotten how to rely on their own instincts, because I lead them to nourishment.
The boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with the sycamore growing from within, had been haunted. It had caused him to have the same dream for a second time, and it was causing him to feel anger toward his faithful companions. He drank a bit from the wine that remained from his dinner of the night before, and he gathered his jacket closer to his body. He knew that a few hours from now, with the sun at its zenith, the heat would be so great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields. It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer. The heat lasted until nightfall, and all that time he had to carry his
jacket. But when he thought to complain about the burden of its weight, he remembered that, because he had the jacket, he had withstood the cold of the dawn.
We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was grateful for the jacket’s weight and warmth.
The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was to travel, and, after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all the cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read. That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen. His parents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of pride for a simple farm family. They worked hard just to have food and water, like the sheep. He had studied Latin, Spanish, and theology. But ever since he had been a child, he had wanted to know the world, and this was much more important to him than knowing God and learning about man’s sins. One afternoon, on a visit to his family, he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he didn’t want to become a priest. That he wanted to travel.
“PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED through this village, son,” said his father. “They come in search of new things, but when they leave they are basically the same people they were when they arrived. They climb the mountain to see the castle, and they wind up thinking that the past was better than what we have now. They have blond hair, or dark skin, but basically they’re the same as the people who live right here.”
“But I’d like to see the castles in the towns where they live,” the boy explained.
“Those people, when they see our land, say that they would like to live here forever,” his father continued.
“Well, I’d like to see their land, and see how they live,” said his son.
“The people who come here have a lot of money to spend, so they can afford to travel,” his father said. “Amongst us, the only ones who travel are the shepherds.”
“Well, then I’ll be a shepherd!”
His father said no more. The next day, he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient Spanish gold coins.
“I found these one day in the fields. I wanted them to be a part of your inheritance. But use them to buy your flock. Take to the fields, and someday you’ll learn that our countryside is the best, and our women are the most beautiful.”
And he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his father’s gaze a desire to be able, himself, to travel the world—a desire that was still alive, despite his father’s having had to bury it, over dozens of years, under the burden of struggling for water to drink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every night of his life.
THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RED, AND SUDDENLY THE sun appeared. The boy thought back to that conversation with his father, and felt happy; he had already seen many castles and met many women (but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence). He owned a jacket, a book that he could trade for another, and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able every day to live out his dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he had had enough of the sea, he
would already have known other cities, other women, and other chances to be happy. I couldn’t have found God in the seminary, he thought, as he looked at the sunrise.
Whenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel. He had never been to that ruined church before, in spite of having traveled through those parts many times. The world was huge and inexhaustible; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a while, and he would discover other interesting things. The problem is that they don’t even realize that they’re walking a new road every day. They don’t see that the fields are new and the seasons change. All they think about is food and water.
Maybe we’re all that way, the boy mused. Even me—I haven’t thought of other women since I met the merchant’s daughter. Looking at the sun, he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before midday. There, he could exchange his book for a thicker one, fill his wine bottle, shave, and have a haircut; he had to prepare himself for his meeting with the girl, and he didn’t want to think about the possibility that some other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep, had arrived there before him and asked for her hand.
It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting, he thought, as he looked again at the position of the sun, and hurried his pace. He had suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa, there was an old woman who interpreted dreams.
THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK of her house; it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads. The room’s furnishings consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and two chairs.
The woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well. Then she took both of his hands in hers, and began quietly to pray.
It sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had experience on the road with Gypsies; they also traveled, but they had no flocks of sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others. It was also said that they had a pact with the devil, and that they kidnapped children and, taking them away to their mysterious camps, made them their slaves. As a child, the boy had always been frightened to death that he would be captured by Gypsies, and this childhood fear returned when the old woman took his hands in hers.
But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to reassure himself. He didn’t want his hand to begin trembling, showing the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our Father silently.
“Very interesting,” said the woman, never taking her eyes from the boy’s hands, and then she fell silent.
The boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and the woman sensed it. He quickly pulled his hands away.
“I didn’t come here to have you read my palm,” he said, already regretting having come. He thought for a moment that it would be better to pay her fee and leave without learning a thing, that he was giving too much importance to his recurrent dream.
“You came so that you could learn about your dreams,” said the old woman. “And dreams are the language of God. When he speaks in our language, I can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in the language of the soul, it is only you who can understand. But, whichever it is, I’m going to charge you for the consultation.”
Another trick, the boy thought. But he decided to take a chance. A shepherd always takes his chances with wolves and with drought, and that’s what makes a shepherd’s life exciting.
“I have had the same dream twice,” he said. “I dreamed that I was in a field with my sheep, when a child appeared and began to play with the animals. I don’t like people to do that, because the sheep are afraid of strangers. But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them. I don’t know why. I don’t know how animals know the age of human beings.”
“Tell me more about your dream,” said the woman. “I have to get back to my cooking, and, since you don’t have much money, I can’t give you a lot of time.”
“The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while,” continued the boy, a bit upset. “And suddenly, the child took me by both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids.”
He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were. But she said nothing.
“Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,”—he said the last three words slowly, so that the old woman would understand—“the child said to me, ‘If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.’ And, just as she was about to show me the exact location, I woke up. Both times.”
The woman was silent for some time. Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully.
“I’m not going to charge you anything now,” she said. “But I want one-tenth of the treasure, if you find it.”
The boy laughed—out of happiness. He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure!
“Well, interpret the dream,” he said.
“First, swear to me. Swear that you will give me one-tenth of your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you.”
The shepherd swore that he would. The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
“It’s a dream in the language of the world,” she said. “I can interpret it, but the interpretation is very difficult. That’s why I feel that I deserve a part of what you find.
“And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in Egypt. I have never heard of them, but, if it was a child who showed them to you, they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make you a rich man.”
The boy was surprised, and then irritated. He didn’t need to seek out the old woman for this! But then he remembered that he wasn’t going to have to pay anything.
“I didn’t need to waste my time just for this,” he said.
“I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It’s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them. And since I am not wise, I have had to learn other arts, such as the reading of palms.”
“Well, how am I going to get to Egypt?”
“I only interpret dreams. I don’t know how to turn them into reality. That’s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with.”
“And what if I never get to Egypt?”
“Then I don’t get paid. It wouldn’t be the first time.”
And the woman told the boy to leave, saying she had already wasted too much time with him.
So the boy was disappointed; he decided that he would never again believe in dreams. He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of: he went to the market for something
to eat, he traded his book for one that was thicker, and he found a bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had bought. The day was hot, and the wine was refreshing. The sheep were at the gates of the city, in a stable that belonged to a friend. The boy knew a lot of people in the city. That was what made traveling appeal to him—he always made new friends, and he didn’t need to spend all of his time with them. When someone sees the same people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary, they wind up becoming a part of that person’s life. And then they want the person to change. If someone isn’t what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.
He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields. Three days from now, he would be with the merchant’s daughter.
He started to read the book he had bought. On the very first page it described a burial ceremony. And the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book, he thought, he would present one person at a time, so that the reader wouldn’t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names.
When he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading, he liked the book better; the burial was on a snowy day, and he welcomed the feeling of being cold. As he read on, an old man sat down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation.
“What are they doing?” the old man asked, pointing at the people in the plaza.
“Working,” the boy answered dryly, making it look as if he wanted to concentrate on his reading.
Actually, he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the merchant’s daughter, so that she could see that he was someone who was capable of doing difficult things. He had already imagined the scene many times; every time, the girl became fascinated when he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front. He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep. Most of them he had read in books, but he would tell them as if they were from his personal experience. She would never know the difference, because she didn’t know how to read.
Meanwhile, the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation. He said that he was tired and thirsty, and asked if he might have a sip of the boy’s wine. The boy offered his bottle, hoping that the old man would leave him alone.
But the old man wanted to talk, and he asked the boy what book he was reading. The boy was tempted to be rude, and move to another bench, but his father had taught him to be respectful of the elderly. So he held out the book to the man—for two reasons: first, that he, himself, wasn’t sure how to pronounce the title; and second, that if the old man didn’t know how to read, he would probably feel ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches.
“Hmm…” said the old man, looking at all sides of the book, as if it were some strange object. “This is an important book, but it’s really irritating.”
The boy was shocked. The old man knew how to read, and had already read the book. And if the book was irritating, as the old man had said, the boy still had time to change it for another.
“It’s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in the world say,” continued the old man. “It describes people’s inability to choose their own Personal Legends. And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world’s greatest lie.”
“What’s the world’s greatest lie?” the boy asked, completely surprised.
“It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That’s the world’s greatest lie.”
“That’s never happened to me,” the boy said. “They wanted me to be a priest, but I decided to become a shepherd.”
“Much better,” said the old man. “Because you really like to travel.”
“He knew what I was thinking,” the boy said to himself. The old man, meanwhile, was leafing through the book, without seeming to want to return it at all. The boy noticed that the man’s clothing was strange. He looked like an Arab, which was not unusual in those parts. Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa; one had only to cross the narrow straits by boat. Arabs often appeared in the city, shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day.
“Where are you from?” the boy asked.
“From many places.”
“No one can be from many places,” the boy said. “I’m a shepherd, and I have been to many places, but I come from only one place—from a city near an ancient castle. That’s where I was born.”
“Well then, we could say that I was born in Salem.”
The boy didn’t know where Salem was, but he didn’t want to ask, fearing that he would appear ignorant. He looked at the people in the plaza for a while; they were coming and going, and all of them seemed to be very busy.
“So, what is Salem like?” he asked, trying to get some sort of clue.
“It’s like it always has been.”
No clue yet. But he knew that Salem wasn’t in Andalusia. If it were, he would already have heard of it.
“And what do you do in Salem?” he insisted.
“What do I do in Salem?” The old man laughed. “Well, I’m the king of Salem!”
People say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it’s better to be with the sheep, who don’t say anything. And better still to be alone with one’s books. They tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them. But when you’re talking to people, they say some things that are so strange that you don’t know how to continue the conversation.
“My name is Melchizedek,” said the old man. “How many sheep do you have?”
“Enough,” said the boy. He could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life.
“Well, then, we’ve got a problem. I can’t help you if you feel you’ve got enough sheep.”
The boy was getting irritated. He wasn’t asking for help. It was the old man who had asked for a drink of his wine, and had started the conversation.
“Give me my book,” the boy said. “I have to go and gather my sheep and get going.”
“Give me one-tenth of your sheep,” said the old man, “and I’ll tell you how to find the hidden treasure.”
The boy remembered his dream, and suddenly everything was clear to him. The old woman hadn’t charged him anything, but the old man—maybe he was her husband—was going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something that didn’t even exist. The old man was probably a Gypsy, too.
But before the boy could say anything, the old man leaned over, picked up a stick, and began to write in the sand of the plaza. Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that
the boy was momentarily blinded. With a movement that was too quick for someone his age, the man covered whatever it was with his cape. When his vision returned to normal, the boy was able to read what the old man had written in the sand.
There, in the sand of the plaza of that small city, the boy read the names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he had attended. He read the name of the merchant’s daughter, which he hadn’t even known, and he read things he had never told anyone.
“I’M THE KING OF SALEM,” THE OLD MAN HAD SAID.
“Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?” the boy asked, awed and embarrassed.
“For several reasons. But let’s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend.”
The boy didn’t know what a person’s “Personal Legend” was.
“It’s what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.
“At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.”
None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy. But he wanted to know what the “mysterious force” was; the merchant’s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that!
“It’s a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you how to realize your Personal Legend. It prepares your spirit and
your will, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your mission on earth.”
“Even when all you want to do is travel? Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant?”
“Yes, or even search for treasure. The Soul of the World is nourished by people’s happiness. And also by unhappiness, envy, and jealousy. To realize one’s Personal Legend is a person’s only real obligation. All things are one.
“And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”
They were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the townspeople. It was the old man who spoke first.
“Why do you tend a flock of sheep?”
“Because I like to travel.”
The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at one corner of the plaza. “When he was a child, that man wanted to travel, too. But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside. When he’s an old man, he’s going to spend a month in Africa. He never realized that people are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.”
“He should have decided to become a shepherd,” the boy said.
“Well, he thought about that,” the old man said. “But bakers are more important people than shepherds. Bakers have homes, while shepherds sleep out in the open. Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds.”
The boy felt a pang in his heart, thinking about the merchant’s daughter. There was surely a baker in her town.
The old man continued, “In the long run, what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends.”
The old man leafed through the book, and fell to reading a page he came to. The boy waited, and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted. “Why are you telling me all this?”
“Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend. And you are at the point where you’re about to give it all up.”
“And that’s when you always appear on the scene?”
“Not always in this way, but I always appear in one form or another. Sometimes I appear in the form of a solution, or a good idea. At other times, at a crucial moment, I make it easier for things to happen. There are other things I do, too, but most of the time people don’t realize I’ve done them.”
The old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to appear before a miner, and had taken the form of a stone. The miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years he had been working a certain river, and had examined hundreds of thousands of stones looking for an emerald. The miner was about to give it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one more stone—just one more—he would find his emerald. Since the miner had sacrificed everything to his Personal Legend, the old man decided to become involved. He transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner’s foot. The miner, with all the anger and frustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the stone and threw it aside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it fell upon, and there, embedded in the broken stone, was the most beautiful emerald in the world.
“People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,” said the old man, with a certain bitterness. “Maybe that’s why they give up on it so early, too. But that’s the way it is.”
The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure.
“Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is buried by the same currents,” said the old man. “If you want to learn about your own treasure, you will have to give me one-tenth of your flock.”
“What about one-tenth of my treasure?”
The old man looked disappointed. “If you start out by promising what you don’t even have yet, you’ll lose your desire to work toward getting it.”
The boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy.
“Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that,” sighed the old man. “In any case, it’s good that you’ve learned that everything in life has its price. This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach.”
The old man returned the book to the boy.
“Tomorrow, at this same time, bring me a tenth of your flock. And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure. Good afternoon.”
And he vanished around the corner of the plaza.
THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK, BUT HE WAS NO longer able to concentrate. He was tense and upset, because he knew that the old man was right. He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of bread, thinking about whether or not he should tell the baker what the old man had said about him. Sometimes it’s better to leave
things as they are, he thought to himself, and decided to say nothing. If he were to say anything, the baker would spend three days thinking about giving it all up, even though he had gotten used to the way things were. The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker. So he began to wander through the city, and found himself at the gates. There was a small building there, with a window at which people bought tickets to Africa. And he knew that Egypt was in Africa.
“Can I help you?” asked the man behind the window.
“Maybe tomorrow,” said the boy, moving away. If he sold just one of his sheep, he’d have enough to get to the other shore of the strait. The idea frightened him.
“Another dreamer,” said the ticket seller to his assistant, watching the boy walk away. “He doesn’t have enough money to travel.”
While standing at the ticket window, the boy had remembered his flock, and decided he should go back to being a shepherd. In two years he had learned everything about shepherding: he knew how to shear sheep, how to care for pregnant ewes, and how to protect the sheep from wolves. He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia. And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals.
He decided to return to his friend’s stable by the longest route possible. As he walked past the city’s castle, he interrupted his return, and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall. From there, he could see Africa in the distance. Someone had once told him that it was from there that the Moors had come, to occupy all of Spain.
He could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including the plaza where he had talked with the old man. Curse the moment I
met that old man, he thought. He had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream. Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd. They were solitary individuals who no longer believed in things, and didn’t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep. He knew everything about each member of his flock: he knew which ones were lame, which one was to give birth two months from now, and which were the laziest. He knew how to shear them, and how to slaughter them. If he ever decided to leave them, they would suffer.
The wind began to pick up. He knew that wind: people called it the levanter, because on it the Moors had come from the Levant at the eastern end of the Mediterranean.
The levanter increased in intensity. Here I am, between my flock and my treasure, the boy thought. He had to choose between something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted to have. There was also the merchant’s daughter, but she wasn’t as important as his flock, because she didn’t depend on him. Maybe she didn’t even remember him. He was sure that it made no difference to her on which day he appeared: for her, every day was the same, and when each day is the same as the next, it’s because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.
I left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. They have gotten used to my being away, and so have I. The sheep will get used to my not being there, too, the boy thought.
From where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued to come and go from the baker’s shop. A young couple sat on the bench where he had talked with the old man, and they kissed.
“That baker…” he said to himself, without completing the thought. The levanter was still getting stronger, and he felt its force on his face. That wind had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women. It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search for the unknown, and for gold and adventure—and for the Pyramids. The boy felt jealous of the freedom of the wind, and saw that he could have the same freedom. There was nothing to hold him back except himself. The sheep, the merchant’s daughter, and the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend.
The next day, the boy met the old man at noon. He brought six sheep with him.
“I’m surprised,” the boy said. “My friend bought all the other sheep immediately. He said that he had always dreamed of being a shepherd, and that it was a good omen.”
“That’s the way it always is,” said the old man. “It’s called the principle of favorability. When you play cards the first time, you are almost sure to win. Beginner’s luck.”
“Why is that?”
“Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend; it whets your appetite with a taste of success.”
Then the old man began to inspect the sheep, and he saw that one was lame. The boy explained that it wasn’t important, since that sheep was the most intelligent of the flock, and produced the most wool.
“Where is the treasure?” he asked.
“It’s in Egypt, near the Pyramids.”
The boy was startled. The old woman had said the same thing. But she hadn’t charged him anything.
“In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens. God has prepared a path for everyone to follow. You just have to read the omens that he left for you.”
Before the boy could reply, a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man. He remembered something his grandfather had once told him: that butterflies were a good omen. Like crickets, and like grasshoppers; like lizards and four-leaf clovers.
“That’s right,” said the old man, able to read the boy’s thoughts. “Just as your grandfather taught you. These are good omens.”
The old man opened his cape, and the boy was struck by what he saw. The old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold, covered with precious stones. The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day.
He really was a king! He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves.
“Take these,” said the old man, holding out a white stone and a black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate. “They are called Urim and Thummim. The black signifies ‘yes,’ and the white ‘no.’ When you are unable to read the omens, they will help you to do so. Always ask an objective question.
“But, if you can, try to make your own decisions. The treasure is at the Pyramids; that you already knew. But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision.”
The boy put the stones in his pouch. From then on, he would make his own decisions.
“Don’t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else. And don’t forget the language of omens. And, above all,
don’t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion.
“But before I go, I want to tell you a little story.
“A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world. The lad wandered through the desert for forty days, and finally came upon a beautiful castle, high atop a mountain. It was there that the wise man lived.
“Rather than finding a saintly man, though, our hero, on entering the main room of the castle, saw a hive of activity: tradesmen came and went, people were conversing in the corners, a small orchestra was playing soft music, and there was a table covered with platters of the most delicious food in that part of the world. The wise man conversed with everyone, and the boy had to wait for two hours before it was his turn to be given the man’s attention.
“The wise man listened attentively to the boy’s explanation of why he had come, but told him that he didn’t have time just then to explain the secret of happiness. He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours.
“‘Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do something,’ said the wise man, handing the boy a teaspoon that held two drops of oil. ‘As you wander around, carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil to spill.’
“The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of the palace, keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon. After two hours, he returned to the room where the wise man was.
“‘Well,’ asked the wise man, ‘did you see the Persian tapestries that are hanging in my dining hall? Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create? Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library?’
“The boy was embarrassed, and confessed that he had observed nothing. His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him.
“‘Then go back and observe the marvels of my world,’ said the wise man. ‘You cannot trust a man if you don’t know his house.’
“Relieved, the boy picked up the spoon and returned to his exploration of the palace, this time observing all of the works of art on the ceilings and the walls. He saw the gardens, the mountains all around him, the beauty of the flowers, and the taste with which everything had been selected. Upon returning to the wise man, he related in detail everything he had seen.
“‘But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you?’ asked the wise man.
“Looking down at the spoon he held, the boy saw that the oil was gone.
“‘Well, there is only one piece of advice I can give you,’ said the wisest of wise men. ‘The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.’”
The shepherd said nothing. He had understood the story the old king had told him. A shepherd may like to travel, but he should never forget about his sheep.
The old man looked at the boy and, with his hands held together, made several strange gestures over the boy’s head. Then, taking his sheep, he walked away.
AT THE HIGHEST POINT IN TARIFA THERE IS AN OLD FORT, built by the Moors. From atop its walls, one can catch a glimpse of Africa. Melchizedek, the king of Salem, sat on the wall of the fort that
afternoon, and felt the levanter blowing in his face. The sheep fidgeted nearby, uneasy with their new owner and excited by so much change. All they wanted was food and water.
Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port. He would never again see the boy, just as he had never seen Abraham again after having charged him his one-tenth fee. That was his work.
The gods should not have desires, because they don’t have Personal Legends. But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful.
It’s too bad that he’s quickly going to forget my name, he thought. I should have repeated it for him. Then when he spoke about me he would say that I am Melchizedek, the king of Salem.
He looked to the skies, feeling a bit abashed, and said, “I know it’s the vanity of vanities, as you said, my Lord. But an old king sometimes has to take some pride in himself.”
HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS, THOUGHT THE BOY.
He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier. Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other. In just a few hours he had seen men walking hand in hand, women with their faces covered, and priests that climbed to the tops of towers and chanted—as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground.
“A practice of infidels,” he said to himself. As a child in church, he had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his white horse, his sword unsheathed, and figures such as these
kneeling at his feet. The boy felt ill and terribly alone. The infidels had an evil look about them.
Besides this, in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail, just one detail, which could keep him from his treasure for a long time: only Arabic was spoken in this country.
The owner of the bar approached him, and the boy pointed to a drink that had been served at the next table. It turned out to be a bitter tea. The boy preferred wine.
But he didn’t need to worry about that right now. What he had to be concerned about was his treasure, and how he was going to go about getting it. The sale of his sheep had left him with enough money in his pouch, and the boy knew that in money there was magic; whoever has money is never really alone. Before long, maybe in just a few days, he would be at the Pyramids. An old man, with a breastplate of gold, wouldn’t have lied just to acquire six sheep.
The old man had spoken about signs and omens, and, as the boy was crossing the strait, he had thought about omens. Yes, the old man had known what he was talking about: during the time the boy had spent in the fields of Andalusia, he had become used to learning which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky. He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a snake was nearby, and that a certain shrub was a sign that there was water in the area. The sheep had taught him that.
If God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he thought, and that made him feel better. The tea seemed less bitter.
“Who are you?” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish.
The boy was relieved. He was thinking about omens, and someone had appeared.
“How come you speak Spanish?” he asked. The new arrival was a young man in Western dress, but the color of his skin suggested he was from this city. He was about the same age and height as the boy.
“Almost everyone here speaks Spanish. We’re only two hours from Spain.”
“Sit down, and let me treat you to something,” said the boy. “And ask for a glass of wine for me. I hate this tea.”
“There is no wine in this country,” the young man said. “The religion here forbids it.”
The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids. He almost began to tell about his treasure, but decided not to do so. If he did, it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as payment for taking him there. He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn’t even have yet.
“I’d like you to take me there if you can. I can pay you to serve as my guide.”
“Do you have any idea how to get there?” the newcomer asked.
The boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby, listening attentively to their conversation. He felt uneasy at the man’s presence. But he had found a guide, and didn’t want to miss out on an opportunity.
“You have to cross the entire Sahara desert,” said the young man. “And to do that, you need money. I need to know whether you have enough.”
The boy thought it a strange question. But he trusted in the old man, who had said that, when you really want something, the universe always conspires in your favor.
He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man. The owner of the bar came over and looked, as well. The two
men exchanged some words in Arabic, and the bar owner seemed irritated.
“Let’s get out of here,” said the new arrival. “He wants us to leave.”
The boy was relieved. He got up to pay the bill, but the owner grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of words. The boy was strong, and wanted to retaliate, but he was in a foreign country. His new friend pushed the owner aside, and pulled the boy outside with him. “He wanted your money,” he said. “Tangier is not like the rest of Africa. This is a port, and every port has its thieves.”
The boy trusted his new friend. He had helped him out in a dangerous situation. He took out his money and counted it.
“We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow,” said the other, taking the money. “But I have to buy two camels.”
They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier. Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale. They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held. There were thousands of people there, arguing, selling, and buying; vegetables for sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed alongside tobacco. But the boy never took his eye off his new friend. After all, he had all his money. He thought about asking him to give it back, but decided that would be unfriendly. He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in.
“I’ll just watch him,” he said to himself. He knew he was stronger than his friend.
Suddenly, there in the midst of all that confusion, he saw the most beautiful sword he had ever seen. The scabbard was embossed in silver, and the handle was black and encrusted with precious
stones. The boy promised himself that, when he returned from Egypt, he would buy that sword.
“Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs,” he said to his friend. Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments, looking at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest had suddenly compressed it. He was afraid to look around, because he knew what he would find. He continued to look at the beautiful sword for a bit longer, until he summoned the courage to turn around.
All around him was the market, with people coming and going, shouting and buying, and the aroma of strange foods…but nowhere could he find his new companion.
The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident. He decided to stay right there and await his return. As he waited, a priest climbed to the top of a nearby tower and began his chant; everyone in the market fell to their knees, touched their foreheads to the ground, and took up the chant. Then, like a colony of worker ants, they dismantled their stalls and left.
The sun began its departure, as well. The boy watched it through its trajectory for some time, until it was hidden behind the white houses surrounding the plaza. He recalled that when the sun had risen that morning, he was on another continent, still a shepherd with sixty sheep, and looking forward to meeting with a girl. That morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him as he walked through the familiar fields. But now, as the sun began to set, he was in a different country, a stranger in a strange land, where he couldn’t even speak the language. He was no longer a shepherd, and he had nothing, not even the money to return and start everything over.
All this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought. He was feeling sorry for himself, and lamenting the fact that his life could have changed so suddenly and so drastically.
He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry. He had never even wept in front of his own sheep. But the marketplace was empty, and he was far from home, so he wept. He wept because God was unfair, and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams.
When I had my sheep, I was happy, and I made those around me happy. People saw me coming and welcomed me, he thought. But now I’m sad and alone. I’m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me. I’m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine. And I’m going to hold on to what little I have, because I’m too insignificant to conquer the world.
He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions; maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship. But all he found was the heavy book, his jacket, and the two stones the old man had given him.
As he looked at the stones, he felt relieved for some reason. He had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate. He could sell the stones and buy a return ticket. But this time I’ll be smarter, the boy thought, removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket. This was a port town, and the only truthful thing his friend had told him was that port towns are full of thieves.
Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset: he was trying to tell him not to trust that man. “I’m like everyone else—I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.”
He ran his fingers slowly over the stones, sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces. They were his treasure. Just handling them made him feel better. They reminded him of the old man.
“When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it,” he had said.
The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said. There he was in the empty marketplace, without a cent to his name, and with not a sheep to guard through the night. But the stones were proof that he had met with a king—a king who knew of the boy’s past.
“They’re called Urim and Thummim, and they can help you to read the omens.” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment. The old man had said to ask very clear questions, and to do that, the boy had to know what he wanted. So, he asked if the old man’s blessing was still with him.
He took out one of the stones. It was “yes.”
“Am I going to find my treasure?” he asked.
He stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the stones. As he did so, both of them pushed through a hole in the pouch and fell to the ground. The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch. He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch. But as he saw them lying there on the ground, another phrase came to his mind.
“Learn to recognize omens, and follow them,” the old king had said.
An omen. The boy smiled to himself. He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch. He didn’t consider mending the hole—the stones could fall through any time they wanted. He had learned that there were certain things one shouldn’t ask about,
so as not to flee from one’s own Personal Legend. “I promised that I would make my own decisions,” he said to himself.
But the stones had told him that the old man was still with him, and that made him feel more confident. He looked around at the empty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn’t a strange place; it was a new one.
After all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new places. Even if he never got to the Pyramids, he had already traveled farther than any shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how different things are just two hours by ship from where they are, he thought. Although his new world at the moment was just an empty marketplace, he had already seen it when it was teeming with life, and he would never forget it. He remembered the sword. It hurt him a bit to think about it, but he had never seen one like it before. As he mused about these things, he realized that he had to choose between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure.
“I’m an adventurer, looking for treasure,” he said to himself.
HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE. HE had fallen asleep in the middle of the marketplace, and life in the plaza was about to resume.
Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he was in a new world. But instead of being saddened, he was happy. He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep; he could go in search of his treasure, instead. He had not a cent in his pocket, but he had faith. He had decided, the night before, that he would be as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books.
He walked slowly through the market. The merchants were assembling their stalls, and the boy helped a candy seller to do his. The candy seller had a smile on his face: he was happy, aware of what his life was about, and ready to begin a day’s work. His smile reminded the boy of the old man—the mysterious old king he had met. “This candy merchant isn’t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper’s daughter. He’s doing it because it’s what he wants to do,” thought the boy. He realized that he could do the same thing the old man had done—sense whether a person was near to or far from his Personal Legend. Just by looking at them. It’s easy, and yet I’ve never done it before, he thought.
When the stall was assembled, the candy seller offered the boy the first sweet he had made for the day. The boy thanked him, ate it, and went on his way. When he had gone only a short distance, he realized that, while they were erecting the stall, one of them had spoken Arabic and the other Spanish.
And they had understood each other perfectly well.
There must be a language that doesn’t depend on words, the boy thought. I’ve already had that experience with my sheep, and now it’s happening with people.
He was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things that he had already experienced, and weren’t really new, but that he had never perceived before. And he hadn’t perceived them because he had become accustomed to them. He realized: If I can learn to understand this language without words, I can learn to understand the world.
Relaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of Tangier. Only in that way would he be able to read the omens. He knew it would require a lot of patience, but shepherds know all about patience. Once again he saw that, in that
strange land, he was applying the same lessons he had learned with his sheep.
“All things are one,” the old man had said.
THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT AWOKE WITH THE DAY, AND FELT the same anxiety that he felt every morning. He had been in the same place for thirty years: a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed. Now it was too late to change anything—the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware. There had been a time when many people knew of his shop: Arab merchants, French and English geologists, German soldiers who were always well-heeled. In those days it had been wonderful to be selling crystal, and he had thought how he would become rich, and have beautiful women at his side as he grew older.
But, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of Ceuta had grown faster than Tangier, and business had fallen off. Neighbors moved away, and there remained only a few small shops on the hill. And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops.
But the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years of his life buying and selling crystal pieces, and now it was too late to do anything else.
He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street. He had done this for years, and knew the schedule of everyone who passed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy stopped in front of the shop. He was dressed normally, but the practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no
money to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant decided to delay his lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on.
A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT several languages were spoken in the shop. The boy saw a man appear behind the counter.
“I can clean up those glasses in the window, if you want,” said the boy. “The way they look now, nobody is going to want to buy them.”
The man looked at him without responding.
“In exchange, you could give me something to eat.”
The man still said nothing, and the boy sensed that he was going to have to make a decision. In his pouch, he had his jacket—he certainly wasn’t going to need it in the desert. Taking the jacket out, he began to clean the glasses. In half an hour, he had cleaned all the glasses in the window, and, as he was doing so, two customers had entered the shop and bought some crystal.
When he had completed the cleaning, he asked the man for something to eat. “Let’s go and have some lunch,” said the crystal merchant.
He put a sign on the door, and they went to a small café nearby. As they sat down at the only table in the place, the crystal merchant laughed.
“You didn’t have to do any cleaning,” he said. “The Koran requires me to feed a hungry person.”
“Well then, why did you let me do it?” the boy asked.
“Because the crystal was dirty. And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts.”
When they had eaten, the merchant turned to the boy and said, “I’d like you to work in my shop. Two customers came in today while you were working, and that’s a good omen.”
People talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they really don’t know what they’re saying. Just as I hadn’t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep.
“Do you want to go to work for me?” the merchant asked.
“I can work for the rest of today,” the boy answered. “I’ll work all night, until dawn, and I’ll clean every piece of crystal in your shop. In return, I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow.”
The merchant laughed. “Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year…even if you earned a good commission selling every piece, you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt. There are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there.”
There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep. No sound from the bazaars, no arguments among the merchants, no men climbing to the towers to chant. No hope, no adventure, no old kings or Personal Legends, no treasure, and no Pyramids. It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy’s soul had. He sat there, staring blankly through the door of the café, wishing that he had died, and that everything would end forever at that moment.
The merchant looked anxiously at the boy. All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared.
“I can give you the money you need to get back to your country, my son,” said the crystal merchant.
The boy said nothing. He got up, adjusted his clothing, and picked up his pouch.
“I’ll work for you,” he said.
And after another long silence, he added, “I need money to buy some sheep.”
PART TWO
THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT for almost a month, and he could see that it wasn’t exactly the kind of job that would make him happy. The merchant spent the entire day mumbling behind the counter, telling the boy to be careful with the pieces and not to break anything.
But he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he was an old grouch, treated him fairly; the boy received a good commission for each piece he sold, and had already been able to put some money aside. That morning he had done some calculating: if he continued to work every day as he had been, he would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep.
“I’d like to build a display case for the crystal,” the boy said to the merchant. “We could place it outside, and attract those people who pass at the bottom of the hill.”
“I’ve never had one before,” the merchant answered. “People will pass by and bump into it, and pieces will be broken.”
“Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them might have died if we had come upon a snake. But that’s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds.”
The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses. He was selling better than ever…as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier’s major attractions.
“Business has really improved,” he said to the boy, after the customer had left. “I’m doing much better, and soon you’ll be able to return to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?”
“Because we have to respond to omens,” the boy said, almost without meaning to; then he regretted what he had said, because the merchant had never met the king.
“It’s called the principle of favorability, beginner’s luck. Because life wants you to achieve your Personal Legend,” the old king had said.
But the merchant understood what the boy had said. The boy’s very presence in the shop was an omen, and, as time passed and money was pouring into the cash drawer, he had no regrets about having hired the boy. The boy was being paid more money than he deserved, because the merchant, thinking that sales wouldn’t amount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate. He had assumed he would soon return to his sheep.
“Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?” he asked, to get away from the business of the display.
“Because I’ve always heard about them,” the boy answered, saying nothing about his dream. The treasure was now nothing but a painful memory, and he tried to avoid thinking about it.
“I don’t know anyone around here who would want to cross the desert just to see the Pyramids,” said the merchant. “They’re just a pile of stones. You could build one in your backyard.”
“You’ve never had dreams of travel,” said the boy, turning to wait on a customer who had entered the shop.
Two days later, the merchant spoke to the boy about the display.
“I don’t much like change,” he said. “You and I aren’t like Hassan, that rich merchant. If he makes a buying mistake, it doesn’t affect him much. But we two have to live with our mistakes.”
That’s true enough, the boy thought, ruefully.
“Why did you think we should have the display?”
“I want to get back to my sheep faster. We have to take advantage when luck is on our side, and do as much to help it as it’s doing to help us. It’s called the principle of favorability. Or beginner’s luck.”
The merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, “The Prophet gave us the Koran, and left us just five obligations to satisfy during our lives. The most important is to believe only in the one true God. The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan, and be charitable to the poor.”
He stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the Prophet. He was a devout man, and, even with all his impatience, he wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law.
“What’s the fifth obligation?” the boy asked.
“Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel,” the merchant answered. “The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a pilgrimage. We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy city of Mecca.
“Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was young, all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start this shop. I thought that someday I’d be rich, and could go to Mecca. I began to make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the shop; the crystals are delicate things. At the same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading for Mecca. Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans with servants and camels, but most of the people making the pilgrimage were poorer than I.
“All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses. One of them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had traveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more
tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather.”
“Well, why don’t you go to Mecca now?” asked the boy.
“Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That’s what helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible café. I’m afraid that if my dream is realized, I’ll have no reason to go on living.
“You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you’re different from me, because you want to realize your dreams. I just want to dream about Mecca. I’ve already imagined a thousand times crossing the desert, arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone, the seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it. I’ve already imagined the people who would be at my side, and those in front of me, and the conversations and prayers we would share. But I’m afraid that it would all be a disappointment, so I prefer just to dream about it.”
That day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display. Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way.
TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED, AND THE SHELF BROUGHT many customers into the crystal shop. The boy estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet another sixty. In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock, and he would be able to do business with the Arabs, because he was now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in the marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim and Thummim,
because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, the boy had become happy in his work, and thought all the time about the day when he would disembark at Tarifa as a winner.
“You must always know what it is that you want,” the old king had said. The boy knew, and was now working toward it. Maybe it was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a thief, and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.
He was proud of himself. He had learned some important things, like how to deal in crystal, and about the language without words…and about omens. One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of the hill, complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to get something to drink after such a climb. The boy, accustomed to recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.
“Let’s sell tea to the people who climb the hill.”
“Lots of places sell tea around here,” the merchant said.
“But we could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses. I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men.”
The merchant didn’t respond, but that afternoon, after saying his prayers and closing the shop, he invited the boy to sit with him and share his hookah, that strange pipe used by the Arabs.
“What is it you’re looking for?” asked the old merchant.
“I’ve already told you. I need to buy my sheep back, so I have to earn the money to do so.”
The merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled deeply.
“I’ve had this shop for thirty years. I know good crystal from bad, and everything else there is to know about crystal. I know its
dimensions and how it behaves. If we serve tea in crystal, the shop is going to expand. And then I’ll have to change my way of life.”
“Well, isn’t that good?”
“I’m already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was thinking about how much time I had wasted in the same place, while my friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better than they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I can see that it hasn’t been too bad. The shop is exactly the size I always wanted it to be. I don’t want to change anything, because I don’t know how to deal with change. I’m used to the way I am.”
The boy didn’t know what to say. The old man continued, “You have been a real blessing to me. Today, I understand something I didn’t see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don’t want anything else in life. But you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I’m going to feel worse than I did before you arrived. Because I know the things I should be able to accomplish, and I don’t want to do so.”
It’s good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa, thought the boy to himself.
They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set. They were conversing in Arabic, and the boy was proud of himself for being able to do so. There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world. But they could never have taught him Arabic.
There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can’t teach me, thought the boy as he regarded the old merchant. All they ever do, really, is look for food and water. And maybe it wasn’t that they were teaching me, but that I was learning from them.
“Maktub,” the merchant said, finally.
“What does that mean?”
“You would have to have been born an Arab to understand,” he answered. “But in your language it would be something like ‘It is written.’”
And, as he smothered the coals in the hookah, he told the boy that he could begin to sell tea in the crystal glasses. Sometimes, there’s just no way to hold back the river.
THE MEN CLIMBED THE HILL, AND THEY WERE TIRED when they reached the top. But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea. They went in to drink the tea, which was served in beautiful crystal glasses.
“My wife never thought of this,” said one, and he bought some crystal—he was entertaining guests that night, and the guests would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware. The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in crystal, because the aroma was retained. The third said that it was a tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers.
Before long, the news spread, and a great many people began to climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old. Other shops were opened that served tea in crystal, but they weren’t at the top of a hill, and they had little business.
Eventually, the merchant had to hire two more employees. He began to import enormous quantities of tea, along with his crystal, and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new.
And, in that way, the months passed.
THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN. IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent.
He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought especially for this day. He put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin. Wearing his new sandals, he descended the stairs silently.
The city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass. Then he sat in the sun-filled doorway, smoking the hookah.
He smoked in silence, thinking of nothing, and listening to the sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert. When he had finished his smoke, he reached into one of his pockets, and sat there for a few moments, regarding what he had withdrawn.
It was a bundle of money. Enough to buy himself a hundred and twenty sheep, a return ticket, and a license to import products from Africa into his own country.
He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop. Then the two went off to have some more tea.
“I’m leaving today,” said the boy. “I have the money I need to buy my sheep. And you have the money you need to go to Mecca.”
The old man said nothing.
“Will you give me your blessing?” asked the boy. “You have helped me.” The man continued to prepare his tea, saying nothing. Then he turned to the boy.
“I am proud of you,” he said. “You brought a new feeling into my crystal shop. But you know that I’m not going to go to Mecca. Just as you know that you’re not going to buy your sheep.”
“Who told you that?” asked the boy, startled.
“Maktub,” said the old crystal merchant.
And he gave the boy his blessing.
THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS. They filled three sacks. As he was leaving, he saw, in the corner of the room, his old shepherd’s pouch. It was bunched up, and he had hardly thought of it for a long time. As he took his jacket out of the pouch, thinking to give it to someone in the street, the two stones fell to the floor. Urim and Thummim.
It made the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize how long it had been since he had thought of him. For nearly a year, he had been working incessantly, thinking only of putting aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride.
“Never stop dreaming,” the old king had said. “Follow the omens.”
The boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the strange sensation that the old king was nearby. He had worked hard for a year, and the omens were that it was time to go.
I’m going to go back to doing just what I did before, the boy thought. Even though the sheep didn’t teach me to speak Arabic.
But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of
things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange city, and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world.
“When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it,” the old king had said.
But the old king hadn’t said anything about being robbed, or about endless deserts, or about people who know what their dreams are but don’t want to realize them. The old king hadn’t told him that the Pyramids were just a pile of stones, or that anyone could build one in his backyard. And he had forgotten to mention that, when you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before, you should buy it.
The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign couple, while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking tea from crystal glasses. It was more activity than usual for this time of the morning. From where he stood, he saw for the first time that the old merchant’s hair was very much like the hair of the old king. He remembered the smile of the candy seller, on his first day in Tangier, when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to go—that smile had also been like the old king’s smile.
It’s almost as if he had been here and left his mark, he thought. And yet, none of these people has ever met the old king. On the other hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are trying to realize their Personal Legend.
He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant. He didn’t want to cry with the other people there. He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned. He was more
confident in himself, though, and felt as though he could conquer the world.
“But I’m going back to the fields that I know, to take care of my flock again.” He said that to himself with certainty, but he was no longer happy with his decision. He had worked for an entire year to make a dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was becoming less important. Maybe because that wasn’t really his dream.
Who knows…maybe it’s better to be like the crystal merchant: never go to Mecca, and just go through life wanting to do so, he thought, again trying to convince himself. But as he held Urim and Thummim in his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and will of the old king. By coincidence—or maybe it was an omen, the boy thought—he came to the bar he had entered on his first day there. The thief wasn’t there, and the owner brought him a cup of tea.
I can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought. I learned how to care for sheep, and I haven’t forgotten how that’s done. But maybe I’ll never have another chance to get to the Pyramids in Egypt. The old man wore a breastplate of gold, and he knew about my past. He really was a king, a wise king.
The hills of Andalusia were only two hours away, but there was an entire desert between him and the Pyramids. Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation: he was actually two hours closer to his treasure…the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn’t matter.
I know why I want to get back to my flock, he thought. I understand sheep; they’re no longer a problem, and they can be good friends. On the other hand, I don’t know if the desert can be a friend, and it’s in the desert that I have to search for my treasure. If I
don’t find it, I can always go home. I finally have enough money, and all the time I need. Why not?
He suddenly felt tremendously happy. He could always go back to being a shepherd. He could always become a crystal salesman again. Maybe the world had other hidden treasures, but he had a dream, and he had met with a king. That doesn’t happen to just anyone!
He was planning as he left the bar. He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant’s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert. He held Urim and Thummim in his hand; because of those two stones, he was once again on the way to his treasure.
“I am always nearby, when someone wants to realize their Personal Legend,” the old king had told him.
What could it cost to go over to the supplier’s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away?
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE that smelled of animals, sweat, and dust; it was part warehouse, part corral. I never thought I’d end up in a place like this, he thought, as he leafed through the pages of a chemical journal. Ten years at the university, and here I am in a corral.
But he had to move on. He believed in omens. All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the universe. First he had studied Esperanto, then the world’s religions, and now it was alchemy. He knew how to speak Esperanto, he understood all the major religions well, but he wasn’t yet an alchemist. He had unraveled the truths behind important questions,
but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go. He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist. But the alchemists were strange people, who thought only about themselves, and almost always refused to help him. Who knows, maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master Work—the Philosopher’s Stone—and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves.
He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father, fruitlessly seeking the Philosopher’s Stone. He had spent enormous amounts of time at the great libraries of the world, and had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy. In one he had read that, many years ago, a famous Arabian alchemist had visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two hundred years old, and that he had discovered the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story. But he would never have thought it more than just a myth, had not a friend of his—returning from an archaeological expedition in the desert—told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers.
“He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,” his friend had said. “And people say that he is two hundred years old, and is able to transform any metal into gold.”
The Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his books, and now here he was, sitting inside a dusty, smelly warehouse. Outside, a huge caravan was being prepared for a crossing of the Sahara, and was scheduled to pass through Al-Fayoum.
I’m going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman thought. And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable.
A young Arab, also loaded down with baggage, entered, and greeted the Englishman.
“Where are you bound?” asked the young Arab.
“I’m going into the desert,” the man answered, turning back to his reading. He didn’t want any conversation at this point. What he needed to do was review all he had learned over the years, because the alchemist would certainly put him to the test.
The young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book was written in Spanish. That’s good, thought the Englishman. He spoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if this boy was going to Al-Fayoum, there would be someone to talk to when there were no other important things to do.
“THAT’S STRANGE,” SAID THE BOY, AS HE TRIED ONCE again to read the burial scene that began the book. “I’ve been trying for two years to read this book, and I never get past these first few pages.” Even without a king to provide an interruption, he was unable to concentrate.
He still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he was able to understand one thing: making a decision was only the beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.
When I decided to seek out my treasure, I never imagined that I’d wind up working in a crystal shop, he thought. And joining this caravan may have been my decision, but where it goes is going to be a mystery to me.
Nearby was the Englishman, reading a book. He seemed unfriendly, and had looked irritated when the boy had entered. They might even have become friends, but the Englishman closed off the conversation.
The boy closed his book. He felt that he didn’t want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman. He took Urim and Thummim from his pocket, and began playing with them.
The stranger shouted, “Urim and Thummim!”
In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket.
“They’re not for sale,” he said.
“They’re not worth much,” the Englishman answered. “They’re only made of rock crystal, and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth. But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim. I didn’t know that they had them in this part of the world.”
“They were given to me as a present by a king,” the boy said.
The stranger didn’t answer; instead, he put his hand in his pocket, and took out two stones that were the same as the boy’s.
“Did you say a king?” he asked.
“I guess you don’t believe that a king would talk to someone like me, a shepherd,” he said, wanting to end the conversation.
“Not at all. It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a king that the rest of the world refused to acknowledge. So, it’s not surprising that kings would talk to shepherds.”
And he went on, fearing that the boy wouldn’t understand what he was talking about, “It’s in the Bible. The same book that taught me about Urim and Thummim. These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God. The priests carried them in a golden breastplate.”
The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse.
“Maybe this is an omen,” said the Englishman, half aloud.
“Who told you about omens?” The boy’s interest was increasing by the moment.
“Everything in life is an omen,” said the Englishman, now closing the journal he was reading. “There is a universal language, understood by everybody, but already forgotten. I am in search of that universal language, among other things. That’s why I’m here. I have to find a man who knows that universal language. An alchemist.”
The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss.
“You’re in luck, you two,” the fat Arab said. “There’s a caravan leaving today for Al-Fayoum.”
“But I’m going to Egypt,” the boy said.
“Al-Fayoum is in Egypt,” said the Arab. “What kind of Arab are you?”
“That’s a good luck omen,” the Englishman said, after the fat Arab had gone out. “If I could, I’d write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence. It’s with those words that the universal language is written.”
He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with Urim and Thummim in his hand. And he asked the boy if he, too, were in search of the alchemist.
“I’m looking for a treasure,” said the boy, and he immediately regretted having said it. But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it.
“In a way, so am I,” he said.
“I don’t even know what alchemy is,” the boy was saying, when the warehouse boss called to them to come outside.
“I’M THE LEADER OF THE CARAVAN,” SAID A DARK-EYED, bearded man. “I hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me. The desert is a capricious lady, and sometimes she drives men crazy.”
There were almost two hundred people gathered there, and four hundred animals—camels, horses, mules, and fowl. In the crowd were women, children, and a number of men with swords at their belts and rifles slung on their shoulders. The Englishman had several suitcases filled with books. There was a babble of noise, and the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying.
“There are a lot of different people here, and each has his own God. But the only God I serve is Allah, and in his name I swear that I will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert. But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what. In the desert, disobedience means death.”
There was a murmur from the crowd. Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God. The boy swore to Jesus Christ. The Englishman said nothing. And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have. The people were also praying to heaven for protection.
A long note was sounded on a bugle, and everyone mounted up. The boy and the Englishman had bought camels, and climbed uncertainly onto their backs. The boy felt sorry for the Englishman’s camel, loaded down as he was with the cases of books.
“There’s no such thing as coincidence,” said the Englishman, picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the
warehouse. “I’m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who…”
But the caravan began to move, and it was impossible to hear what the Englishman was saying. The boy knew what he was about to describe, though: the mysterious chain that links one thing to another, the same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd, that had caused his recurring dream, that had brought him to a city near Africa, to find a king, and to be robbed in order to meet a crystal merchant, and…
The closer one gets to realizing his Personal Legend, the more that Personal Legend becomes his true reason for being, thought the boy.
The caravan moved toward the east. It traveled during the morning, halted when the sun was at its strongest, and resumed late in the afternoon. The boy spoke very little with the Englishman, who spent most of his time with his books.
The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert. Now everything was quite different from how it was that day they had set out: then, there had been confusion and shouting, the cries of children and the whinnying of animals, all mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants.
But, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind, and of the hoofbeats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very little to one another.
“I’ve crossed these sands many times,” said one of the camel drivers one night. “But the desert is so huge, and the horizons so distant, that they make a person feel small, and as if he should remain silent.”
The boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever having set foot in the desert before. Whenever he saw the sea, or a fire, he fell silent, impressed by their elemental force.
I’ve learned things from the sheep, and I’ve learned things from crystal, he thought. I can learn something from the desert, too. It seems old and wise.
The wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face. It reminded him of the wool from his sheep…his sheep who were now seeking food and water in the fields of Andalusia, as they always had.
“They’re not my sheep anymore,” he said to himself, without nostalgia. “They must be used to their new shepherd, and have probably already forgotten me. That’s good. Creatures like the sheep, that are used to traveling, know about moving on.”
He thought of the merchant’s daughter, and was sure that she had probably married. Perhaps to a baker, or to another shepherd who could read and could tell her exciting stories—after all, he probably wasn’t the only one. But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver’s comment: maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the present of all people. “Hunches,” his mother used to call them. The boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and we are able to know everything, because it’s all written there.
“Maktub,” the boy said, remembering the crystal merchant.
The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others. When the caravan was blocked by a boulder, it had to go around it; if there was a large rocky area, they had to make a major detour. If
the sand was too fine for the animals’ hooves, they sought a way where the sand was more substantial. In some places, the ground was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes. The animals balked at such places, and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden their charges. The drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels. If a guide were to fall ill or die, the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one.
But all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many detours and adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the same compass point. Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to its course, sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis. When the people saw that star shining in the morning sky, they knew they were on the right course toward water, palm trees, shelter, and other people. It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all this; he was, for the most part, immersed in reading his books.
The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the first few days of the journey. But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had learned to know his camel better, and to establish a relationship with him, he threw the book away. Although the boy had developed a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn something important, he decided it was an unnecessary burden.
He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him. At night, as they sat around the fire, the boy related to the driver his adventures as a shepherd.
During one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life.
“I used to live near El Cairum,” he said. “I had my orchard, my children, and a life that would change not at all until I died. One
year, when the crop was the best ever, we all went to Mecca, and I satisfied the only unmet obligation in my life. I could die happily, and that made me feel good.
“One day, the earth began to tremble, and the Nile overflowed its banks. It was something that I thought could happen only to others, never to me. My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive trees in the flood, and my wife was afraid that we would lose our children. I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed.
“The land was ruined, and I had to find some other way to earn a living. So now I’m a camel driver. But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah: people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.
“We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it’s our life or our possessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand.”
Sometimes, their caravan met with another. One always had something that the other needed—as if everything were indeed written by one hand. As they sat around the fire, the camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms, and told stories about the desert.
At other times, mysterious, hooded men would appear; they were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route. They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes. They came in silence and departed the same way, dressed in black garments that showed only their eyes. One night, a camel driver came to the fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting. “There are rumors of tribal wars,” he told them.
The three fell silent. The boy noted that there was a sense of fear in the air, even though no one said anything. Once again he was experiencing the language without words…the universal language.
The Englishman asked if they were in danger.
“Once you get into the desert, there’s no going back,” said the camel driver. “And, when you can’t go back, you have to worry only about the best way of moving forward. The rest is up to Allah, including the danger.”
And he concluded by saying the mysterious word: “Maktub.”
“You should pay more attention to the caravan,” the boy said to the Englishman, after the camel driver had left. “We make a lot of detours, but we’re always heading for the same destination.”
“And you ought to read more about the world,” answered the Englishman. “Books are like caravans in that respect.”
The immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster. The days had always been silent, but now, even the nights—when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires—had also become quiet. And, one day, the leader of the caravan made the decision that the fires should no longer be lighted, so as not to attract attention to the caravan.
The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a circle at night, sleeping together in the center as protection against the nocturnal cold. And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group.
The Englishman was unable to sleep one night. He called to the boy, and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment. There was a full moon, and the boy told the Englishman the story of his life.
The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there.
“That’s the principle that governs all things,” he said. “In alchemy, it’s called the Soul of the World. When you want something with all your heart, that’s when you are closest to the Soul of the World. It’s always a positive force.”
He also said that this was not just a human gift, that everything on the face of the earth had a soul, whether mineral, vegetable, or animal—or even just a simple thought.
“Everything on earth is being continuously transformed, because the earth is alive…and it has a soul. We are part of that soul, so we rarely recognize that it is working for us. But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success.”
The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands. “I have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert,” he said. “The caravan and the desert speak the same language, and it’s for that reason that the desert allows the crossing. It’s going to test the caravan’s every step to see if it’s in time, and, if it is, we will make it to the oasis.”
“If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal courage, but without understanding that language, this journey would have been much more difficult.”
They stood there looking at the moon.
“That’s the magic of omens,” said the boy. “I’ve seen how the guides read the signs of the desert, and how the soul of the caravan speaks to the soul of the desert.”
The Englishman said, “I’d better pay more attention to the caravan.”
“And I’d better read your books,” said the boy.
THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS. THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY, salt, dragons, and kings, and he didn’t understand any of it. But there was one idea that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books: all things are the manifestation of one thing only.
In one of the books he learned that the most important text in the literature of alchemy contained only a few lines, and had been inscribed on the surface of an emerald.
“It’s the Emerald Tablet,” said the Englishman, proud that he might teach something to the boy.
“Well, then, why do we need all these books?” the boy asked.
“So that we can understand those few lines,” the Englishman answered, without appearing really to believe what he had said.
The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists. They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories; they believed that, if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and what was left would be the Soul of the World. This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything on the face of the earth, because it was the language with which all things communicated. They called that discovery the Master Work—it was part liquid and part solid.
“Can’t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language?” the boy asked.
“You have a mania for simplifying everything,” answered the Englishman, irritated. “Alchemy is a serious discipline. Every step has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters.”
The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was called the Elixir of Life, and that it cured all illnesses; it also kept the
alchemist from growing old. And the solid part was called the Philosopher’s Stone.
“It’s not easy to find the Philosopher’s Stone,” said the Englishman. “The alchemists spent years in their laboratories, observing the fire that purified the metals. They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world. They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves.”
The boy thought about the crystal merchant. He had said that it was a good thing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces, so that he could free himself from negative thoughts. The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one’s daily life.
“Also,” said the Englishman, “the Philosopher’s Stone has a fascinating property. A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold.”
Having heard that, the boy became even more interested in alchemy. He thought that, with some patience, he’d be able to transform everything into gold. He read the lives of the various people who had succeeded in doing so: Helvétius, Elias, Fulcanelli, and Geber. They were fascinating stories: each of them lived out his Personal Legend to the end. They traveled, spoke with wise men, performed miracles for the incredulous, and owned the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life.
But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master Work, he became completely lost. There were just drawings, coded instructions, and obscure texts.
“WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED?” HE asked the Englishman one night. The boy had noticed that the Englishman was irritable, and missed his books.
“So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand,” he said. “Imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold. Gold would lose its value.
“It’s only those who are persistent, and willing to study things deeply, who achieve the Master Work. That’s why I’m here in the middle of the desert. I’m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes.”
“When were these books written?” the boy asked.
“Many centuries ago.”
“They didn’t have the printing press in those days,” the boy argued. “There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy. Why did they use such strange language, with so many drawings?”
The Englishman didn’t answer him directly. He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan operated, but that he hadn’t learned anything new. The only thing he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent.
THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE Englishman. “Did you learn anything?” the Englishman asked, eager to hear what it might be. He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war.
“I learned that the world has a soul, and that whoever understands that soul can also understand the language of things. I learned that many alchemists realized their Personal Legends, and
wound up discovering the Soul of the World, the Philosopher’s Stone, and the Elixir of Life.
“But, above all, I learned that these things are all so simple that they could be written on the surface of an emerald.”
The Englishman was disappointed. The years of research, the magic symbols, the strange words, and the laboratory equipment…none of this had made an impression on the boy. His soul must be too primitive to understand those things, he thought.
He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags.
“Go back to watching the caravan,” he said. “That didn’t teach me anything, either.”
The boy went back to contemplating the silence of the desert, and the sand raised by the animals. “Everyone has his or her own way of learning things,” he said to himself. “His way isn’t the same as mine, nor mine as his. But we’re both in search of our Personal Legends, and I respect him for that.”
THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT. THE hooded Bedouins reappeared more and more frequently, and the camel driver—who had become a good friend of the boy’s—explained that the war between the tribes had already begun. The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis.
The animals were exhausted, and the men talked among themselves less and less. The silence was the worst aspect of the night, when the mere groan of a camel—which before had been nothing but the groan of a camel—now frightened everyone, because it might signal a raid.
The camel driver, though, seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war.
“I’m alive,” he said to the boy, as they ate a bunch of dates one night, with no fires and no moon. “When I’m eating, that’s all I think about. If I’m on the march, I just concentrate on marching. If I have to fight, it will be just as good a day to die as any other.
“Because I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man. You’ll see that there is life in the desert, that there are stars in the heavens, and that tribesmen fight because they are part of the human race. Life will be a party for you, a grand festival, because life is the moment we’re living right now.”
Two nights later, as he was getting ready to bed down, the boy looked for the star they followed every night. He thought that the horizon was a bit lower than it had been, because he seemed to see stars on the desert itself.
“It’s the oasis,” said the camel driver.
“Well, why don’t we go there right now?” the boy asked.
“Because we have to sleep.”
THE BOY AWOKE AS THE SUN ROSE. THERE, IN FRONT OF him, where the small stars had been the night before, was an endless row of date palms, stretching across the entire desert.
“We’ve done it!” said the Englishman, who had also awakened early.
But the boy was quiet. He was at home with the silence of the desert, and he was content just to look at the trees. He still had a long way to go to reach the Pyramids, and someday this morning
would just be a memory. But this was the present moment—the party the camel driver had mentioned—and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future. Although the vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory, right now it signified shade, water, and a refuge from the war. Yesterday, the camel’s groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms could herald a miracle.
The world speaks many languages, the boy thought.
THE TIMES RUSH PAST, AND SO DO THE CARAVANS, thought the alchemist, as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the oasis. People were shouting at the new arrivals, dust obscured the desert sun, and the children of the oasis were bursting with excitement at the arrival of the strangers. The alchemist saw the tribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan, and converse with him at length.
But none of that mattered to the alchemist. He had already seen many people come and go, and the desert remained as it was. He had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands. The dunes were changed constantly by the wind, yet these were the same sands he had known since he was a child. He always enjoyed seeing the happiness that the travelers experienced when, after weeks of yellow sand and blue sky, they first saw the green of the date palms. Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date trees, he thought.
He decided to concentrate on more practical matters. He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets. The omens had told him so. He didn’t know the man
yet, but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared. He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice.
I don’t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth, he thought. It wasn’t exactly that they were secrets; God revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures.
He had only one explanation for this fact: things have to be transmitted this way because they were made up from the pure life, and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words.
Because people become fascinated with pictures and words, and wind up forgetting the Language of the World.
THE BOY COULDN’T BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS SEEING: THE oasis, rather than being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees—as he had seen once in a geography book—was much larger than many towns back in Spain. There were three hundred wells, fifty thousand date trees, and innumerable colored tents spread among them.
“It looks like A Thousand and One Nights,” said the Englishman, impatient to meet with the alchemist.
They were surrounded by children, curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving. The men of the oasis wanted to know if they had seen any fighting, and the women competed with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants. The silence of the desert was a distant dream; the travelers in the caravan were talking incessantly, laughing and shouting, as if they had emerged from the spiritual world and found themselves once again in the world of people. They were relieved and happy.
They had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always considered to be neutral territories, because the majority of the inhabitants were women and children. There were oases throughout the desert, but the tribesmen fought in the desert, leaving the oases as places of refuge.
With some difficulty, the leader of the caravan brought all his people together and gave them his instructions. The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was over. Since they were visitors, they would have to share living space with those who lived there, and would be given the best accommodations. That was the law of hospitality. Then he asked that everyone, including his own sentinels, hand over their arms to the men appointed by the tribal chieftains.
“Those are the rules of war,” the leader explained. “The oases may not shelter armies or troops.”
To the boy’s surprise, the Englishman took a chrome-plated revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms.
“Why a revolver?” he asked.
“It helped me to trust in people,” the Englishman answered.
Meanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure. The closer he got to the realization of his dream, the more difficult things became. It seemed as if what the old king had called “beginner’s luck” were no longer functioning. In his pursuit of the dream, he was being constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage. So he could not be hasty, nor impatient. If he pushed forward impulsively, he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path.
God placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with the thought. Until then, he had considered the omens to be things of
this world. Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a job. He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do.
“Don’t be impatient,” he repeated to himself. “It’s like the camel driver said: ‘Eat when it’s time to eat. And move along when it’s time to move along.’”
That first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the Englishman. The boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a tent with five other young men of about his age. They were people of the desert, and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities.
The boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent.
“I’ve been looking for you all morning,” he said, as he led the boy outside. “I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives.”
First, they tried to find him on their own. An alchemist would probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the people at the oasis, and it was likely that in his tent an oven was continuously burning. They searched everywhere, and found that the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined; there were hundreds of tents.
“We’ve wasted almost the entire day,” said the Englishman, sitting down with the boy near one of the wells.
“Maybe we’d better ask someone,” the boy suggested.
The Englishman didn’t want to tell others about his reasons for being at the oasis, and couldn’t make up his mind. But, finally, he agreed that the boy, who spoke better Arabic than he, should do so. The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water.
“Good afternoon, ma’am. I’m trying to find out where the alchemist lives here at the oasis.”
The woman said she had never heard of such a person, and hurried away. But before she fled, she advised the boy that he had better not try to converse with women who were dressed in black, because they were married women. He should respect tradition.
The Englishman was disappointed. It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing. The boy was also saddened; his friend was in pursuit of his Personal Legend. And, when someone was in such pursuit, the entire universe made an effort to help him succeed—that’s what the old king had said. He couldn’t have been wrong.
“I had never heard of alchemists before,” the boy said. “Maybe no one here has, either.”
The Englishman’s eyes lit up. “That’s it! Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is! Find out who it is who cures the people’s illnesses!”
Several women dressed in black came to the well for water, but the boy would speak to none of them, despite the Englishman’s insistence. Then a man approached.
“Do you know someone here who cures people’s illnesses?” the boy asked.
“Allah cures our illnesses,” said the man, clearly frightened of the strangers. “You’re looking for witch doctors.” He spoke some verses from the Koran, and moved on.
Another man appeared. He was older, and was carrying a small bucket. The boy repeated his question.
“Why do you want to find that sort of person?” the Arab asked.
“Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to meet with him,” the boy said.
“If such a man is here at the oasis, he must be the very powerful one,” said the old man after thinking for a few moments. “Not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to. Only when he consents.
“Wait for the end of the war. Then leave with the caravan. Don’t try to enter into the life of the oasis,” he said, and walked away.
But the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track.
Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. She had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist.
At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him. When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke—the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at the well. She smiled, and that was certainly an omen—the omen he had been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life. The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.
It was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time. What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. He was more certain of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person
before becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language. Because, when you know that language, it’s easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether it’s in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such love, one’s dreams would have no meaning.
Maktub, thought the boy.
The Englishman shook the boy: “Come on, ask her!”
The boy stepped closer to the girl, and when she smiled, he did the same.
“What’s your name?” he asked.
“Fatima,” the girl said, averting her eyes.
“That’s what some women in my country are called.”
“It’s the name of the Prophet’s daughter,” Fatima said. “The invaders carried the name everywhere.” The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride.
The Englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the man who cured people’s illnesses.
“That’s the man who knows all the secrets of the world,” she said. “He communicates with the genies of the desert.”
The genies were the spirits of good and evil. And the girl pointed to the south, indicating that it was there the strange man lived. Then she filled her vessel with water and left.
The Englishman vanished, too, gone to find the alchemist. And the boy sat there by the well for a long time, remembering that one day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that
woman, and realizing that he had loved her before he even knew she existed. He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world.
The next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl. To his surprise, the Englishman was there, looking out at the desert.
“I waited all afternoon and evening,” he said. “He appeared with the first stars of evening. I told him what I was seeking, and he asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold. I told him that was what I had come here to learn.
“He told me I should try to do so. That’s all he said: ‘Go and try.’”
The boy didn’t say anything. The poor Englishman had traveled all this way, only to be told that he should repeat what he had already done so many times.
“So, then try,” he said to the Englishman.
“That’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to start now.”
As the Englishman left, Fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water.
“I came to tell you just one thing,” the boy said. “I want you to be my wife. I love you.”
The girl dropped the container, and the water spilled.
“I’m going to wait here for you every day. I have crossed the desert in search of a treasure that is somewhere near the Pyramids, and for me, the war seemed a curse. But now it’s a blessing, because it brought me to you.”
“The war is going to end someday,” the girl said.
The boy looked around him at the date palms. He reminded himself that he had been a shepherd, and that he could be a shepherd again. Fatima was more important than his treasure.
“The tribesmen are always in search of treasure,” the girl said, as if she had guessed what he was thinking. “And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen.”
She refilled her vessel and left.
The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima. He told her about his life as a shepherd, about the king, and about the crystal shop. They became friends, and except for the fifteen minutes he spent with her, each day seemed that it would never pass. When he had been at the oasis for almost a month, the leader of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him.
“We don’t know when the war will end, so we can’t continue our journey,” he said. “The battles may last for a long time, perhaps even years. There are powerful forces on both sides, and the war is important to both armies. It’s not a battle of good against evil. It’s a war between forces that are fighting for the balance of power, and, when that type of battle begins, it lasts longer than others—because Allah is on both sides.”
The people went back to where they were living, and the boy went to meet with Fatima that afternoon. He told her about the morning’s meeting. “The day after we met,” Fatima said, “you told me that you loved me. Then, you taught me something of the universal language and the Soul of the World. Because of that, I have become a part of you.”
The boy listened to the sound of her voice, and thought it to be more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms.
“I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time. I have forgotten about my past, about my traditions, and the way in which men of the desert expect women to behave. Ever since I was a
child, I have dreamed that the desert would bring me a wonderful present. Now, my present has arrived, and it’s you.”
The boy wanted to take her hand. But Fatima’s hands held to the handles of her jug.
“You have told me about your dreams, about the old king and your treasure. And you’ve told me about omens. So now, I fear nothing, because it was those omens that brought you to me. And I am a part of your dream, a part of your Personal Legend, as you call it.
“That’s why I want you to continue toward your goal. If you have to wait until the war is over, then wait. But if you have to go before then, go on in pursuit of your dream. The dunes are changed by the wind, but the desert never changes. That’s the way it will be with our love for each other.
“Maktub,” she said. “If I am really a part of your dream, you’ll come back one day.”
The boy was sad as he left her that day. He thought of all the married shepherds he had known. They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields. Love required them to stay with the people they loved.
He told Fatima that, at their next meeting.
“The desert takes our men from us, and they don’t always return,” she said. “We know that, and we are used to it. Those who don’t return become a part of the clouds, a part of the animals that hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth. They become a part of everything…they become the Soul of the World.
“Some do come back. And then the other women are happy because they believe that their men may one day return, as well. I used to look at those women and envy them their happiness. Now, I too will be one of the women who wait.
“I’m a desert woman, and I’m proud of that. I want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes. And, if I have to, I will accept the fact that he has become a part of the clouds, and the animals, and the water of the desert.”
The boy went to look for the Englishman. He wanted to tell him about Fatima. He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman had built himself a furnace outside his tent. It was a strange furnace, fueled by firewood, with a transparent flask heating on top. As the Englishman stared out at the desert, his eyes seemed brighter than they had when he was reading his books.
“This is the first phase of the job,” he said. “I have to separate out the sulfur. To do that successfully, I must have no fear of failure. It was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master Work. Now, I’m beginning what I could have started ten years ago. But I’m happy at least that I didn’t wait twenty years.”
He continued to feed the fire, and the boy stayed on until the desert turned pink in the setting sun. He felt the urge to go out into the desert, to see if its silence held the answers to his questions.
He wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight. He listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his feet. Here and there, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in remote times, had been a sea. He sat on a stone, and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon. He tried to deal with the concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldn’t separate them. But Fatima was a woman of the desert, and, if anything could help him to understand, it was the desert.
As he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him. Looking up, he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky.
He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind. Although their flight appeared to have no pattern, it made a certain kind of
sense to the boy. It was just that he couldn’t grasp what it meant. He followed the movement of the birds, trying to read something into it. Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership.
He felt sleepy. In his heart, he wanted to remain awake, but he also wanted to sleep. “I am learning the Language of the World, and everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me…even the flight of the hawks,” he said to himself. And, in that mood, he was grateful to be in love. When you are in love, things make even more sense, he thought.
Suddenly, one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky, attacking the other. As it did so, a sudden, fleeting image came to the boy: an army, with its swords at the ready, riding into the oasis. The vision vanished immediately, but it had shaken him. He had heard people speak of mirages, and had already seen some himself: they were desires that, because of their intensity, materialized over the sands of the desert. But he certainly didn’t desire that an army invade the oasis.
He wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his meditation. He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert, and its stones. But there was something there in his heart that wouldn’t allow him to do so.
“Always heed the omens,” the old king had said. The boy recalled what he had seen in the vision, and sensed that it was actually going to occur.
He rose, and made his way back toward the palm trees. Once again, he perceived the many languages in the things about him: this time, the desert was safe, and it was the oasis that had become dangerous.
The camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree, observing the sunset. He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes.
“An army is coming,” the boy said. “I had a vision.”
“The desert fills men’s hearts with visions,” the camel driver answered.
But the boy told him about the hawks: that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World.
The camel driver understood what the boy was saying. He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history of all things. One could open a book to any page, or look at a person’s hand; one could turn a card, or watch the flight of the birds…whatever the thing observed, one could find a connection with his experience of the moment. Actually, it wasn’t that those things, in themselves, revealed anything at all; it was just that people, looking at what was occurring around them, could find a means of penetration to the Soul of the World.
The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World. They were known as seers, and they were held in fear by women and the elderly. Tribesmen were also wary of consulting them, because it would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was fated to die. The tribesmen preferred the taste of battle, and the thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be; the future was already written by Allah, and what he had written was always for the good of man. So the tribesmen lived only for the present, because the present was full of surprises, and they had to be aware of many things: Where was the enemy’s sword? Where was his horse? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to
remain alive? The camel driver was not a fighter, and he had consulted with seers. Many of them had been right about what they said, while some had been wrong. Then, one day, the oldest seer he had ever sought out (and the one most to be feared) had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future.
“Well…so I can do things,” he had responded. “And so I can change those things that I don’t want to happen.”
“But then they wouldn’t be a part of your future,” the seer had said.
“Well, maybe I just want to know the future so I can prepare myself for what’s coming.”
“If good things are coming, they will be a pleasant surprise,” said the seer. “If bad things are, and you know in advance, you will suffer greatly before they even occur.”
“I want to know about the future because I’m a man,” the camel driver had said to the seer. “And men always live their lives based on the future.”
The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs; he threw them on the ground, and made interpretations based on how they fell. That day, he didn’t make a cast. He wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put them back in his bag.
“I make my living forecasting the future for people,” he said. “I know the science of the twigs, and I know how to use them to penetrate to the place where all is written. There, I can read the past, discover what has already been forgotten, and understand the omens that are here in the present.
“When people consult me, it’s not that I’m reading the future; I am guessing at the future. The future belongs to God, and it is only he who reveals it, under extraordinary circumstances. How do I guess at the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is
here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better. Forget about the future, and live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.”
The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future.
“Only when he, himself, reveals it. And God only rarely reveals the future. When he does so, it is for only one reason: it’s a future that was written so as to be altered.”
God had shown the boy a part of the future, the camel driver thought. Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument?
“Go and speak to the tribal chieftains,” said the camel driver. “Tell them about the armies that are approaching.”
“They’ll laugh at me.”
“They are men of the desert, and the men of the desert are used to dealing with omens.”
“Well, then, they probably already know.”
“They’re not concerned with that right now. They believe that if they have to know about something Allah wants them to know, someone will tell them about it. It has happened many times before. But, this time, the person is you.”
The boy thought of Fatima. And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes.
THE BOY APPROACHED THE GUARD AT THE FRONT OF THE huge white tent at the center of the oasis.
“I want to see the chieftains. I’ve brought omens from the desert.”
Without responding, the guard entered the tent, where he remained for some time. When he emerged, it was with a young Arab, dressed in white and gold. The boy told the younger man what he had seen, and the man asked him to wait there. He disappeared into the tent.
Night fell, and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent. One by one, the campfires were extinguished, and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert. Only the lights in the great tent remained. During all this time, the boy thought about Fatima, and he was still unable to understand his last conversation with her.
Finally, after hours of waiting, the guard bade the boy enter. The boy was astonished by what he saw inside. Never could he have imagined that, there in the middle of the desert, there existed a tent like this one. The ground was covered with the most beautiful carpets he had ever walked upon, and from the top of the structure hung lamps of handwrought gold, each with a lighted candle. The tribal chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle, resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions. Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea. Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs. The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke.
There were eight chieftains, but the boy could see immediately which of them was the most important: an Arab dressed in white and gold, seated at the center of the semicircle. At his side was the young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier.
“Who is this stranger who speaks of omens?” asked one of the chieftains, eyeing the boy.
“It is I,” the boy answered. And he told what he had seen.
“Why would the desert reveal such things to a stranger, when it knows that we have been here for generations?” said another of the chieftains.
“Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert,” the boy said. “I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see.”
And also because I know about the Soul of the World, he thought to himself.
“The oasis is neutral ground. No one attacks an oasis,” said a third chieftain.
“I can only tell you what I saw. If you don’t want to believe me, you don’t have to do anything about it.”
The men fell into an animated discussion. They spoke in an Arabic dialect that the boy didn’t understand, but, when he made to leave, the guard told him to stay. The boy became fearful; the omens told him that something was wrong. He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert.
Suddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly, and the boy felt better. The man hadn’t participated in the discussion, and, in fact, hadn’t said a word up to that point. But the boy was already used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent. Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming.
The discussion ended. The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying. Then he turned to the boy: this time his expression was cold and distant.
“Two thousand years ago, in a distant land, a man who believed in dreams was thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave,” the old man said, now in the dialect the boy understood. “Our
merchants bought that man, and brought him to Egypt. All of us know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them.”
The elder continued, “When the pharaoh dreamed of cows that were thin and cows that were fat, this man I’m speaking of rescued Egypt from famine. His name was Joseph. He, too, was a stranger in a strange land, like you, and he was probably about your age.”
He paused, and his eyes were still unfriendly.
“We always observe the Tradition. The Tradition saved Egypt from famine in those days, and made the Egyptians the wealthiest of peoples. The Tradition teaches men how to cross the desert, and how their children should marry. The Tradition says that an oasis is neutral territory, because both sides have oases, and so both are vulnerable.”
No one said a word as the old man continued.
“But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert. Everything we know was taught to us by the desert.”
The old man gave a signal, and everyone stood. The meeting was over. The hookahs were extinguished, and the guards stood at attention. The boy made ready to leave, but the old man spoke again:
“Tomorrow, we are going to break the agreement that says that no one at the oasis may carry arms. Throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies. When the sun sets, the men will once again surrender their arms to me. For every ten dead men among our enemies, you will receive a piece of gold.
“But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle. Arms are as capricious as the desert, and, if they are not used, the next time they might not function. If at least one of them hasn’t been used by the end of the day tomorrow, one will be used on you.”
When the boy left the tent, the oasis was illuminated only by the light of the full moon. He was twenty minutes from his tent, and began to make his way there.
He was alarmed by what had happened. He had succeeded in reaching through to the Soul of the World, and now the price for having done so might be his life. It was a frightening bet. But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to pursue his Personal Legend. And, as the camel driver had said, to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day. Every day was there to be lived or to mark one’s departure from this world. Everything depended on one word: “Maktub.”
Walking along in the silence, he had no regrets. If he died tomorrow, it would be because God was not willing to change the future. He would at least have died after having crossed the strait, after having worked in a crystal shop, and after having known the silence of the desert and Fatima’s eyes. He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago. If he died tomorrow, he would already have seen more than other shepherds, and he was proud of that.
Suddenly he heard a thundering sound, and he was thrown to the ground by a wind such as he had never known. The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view. Before him was an enormous white horse, rearing over him with a frightening scream.
When the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at what he saw. Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in black, with a falcon perched on his left shoulder. He wore a turban and his entire face, except for his eyes, was covered with a black kerchief. He appeared to be a messenger from the
desert, but his presence was much more powerful than that of a mere messenger.
The strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle. The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon.
“Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks?” he demanded, so loudly that his words seemed to echo through the fifty thousand palm trees of Al-Fayoum.
“It is I who dared to do so,” said the boy. He was reminded of the image of Santiago Matamoros, mounted on his white horse, with the infidels beneath his hooves. This man looked exactly the same, except that now the roles were reversed.
“It is I who dared to do so,” he repeated, and he lowered his head to receive a blow from the sword. “Many lives will be saved, because I was able to see through to the Soul of the World.”
The sword didn’t fall. Instead, the stranger lowered it slowly, until the point touched the boy’s forehead. It drew a droplet of blood.
The horseman was completely immobile, as was the boy. It didn’t even occur to the boy to flee. In his heart, he felt a strange sense of joy: he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend. And for Fatima. The omens had been true, after all. Here he was, face-to-face with his enemy, but there was no need to be concerned about dying—the Soul of the World awaited him, and he would soon be a part of it. And, tomorrow, his enemy would also be a part of that Soul.
The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy’s forehead. “Why did you read the flight of the birds?”
“I read only what the birds wanted to tell me. They wanted to save the oasis. Tomorrow all of you will die, because there are more men at the oasis than you have.”
The sword remained where it was. “Who are you to change what Allah has willed?”
“Allah created the armies, and he also created the hawks. Allah taught me the language of the birds. Everything has been written by the same hand,” the boy said, remembering the camel driver’s words.
The stranger withdrew the sword from the boy’s forehead, and the boy felt immensely relieved. But he still couldn’t flee.
“Be careful with your prognostications,” said the stranger. “When something is written, there is no way to change it.”
“All I saw was an army,” said the boy. “I didn’t see the outcome of the battle.”
The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer. But he kept the sword in his hand. “What is a stranger doing in a strange land?”
“I am following my Personal Legend. It’s not something you would understand.”
The stranger placed his sword in its scabbard, and the boy relaxed.
“I had to test your courage,” the stranger said. “Courage is the quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World.”
The boy was surprised. The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about.
“You must not let up, even after having come so far,” he continued. “You must love the desert, but never trust it completely. Because the desert tests all men: it challenges every step, and kills those who become distracted.”
What he said reminded the boy of the old king.
“If the warriors come here, and your head is still on your shoulders at sunset, come and find me,” said the stranger.
The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip. The horse reared again, raising a cloud of dust.
“Where do you live?” shouted the boy, as the horseman rode away.
The hand with the whip pointed to the south.
The boy had met the alchemist.
NEXT MORNING, THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMED men scattered throughout the palm trees at Al-Fayoum. Before the sun had reached its high point, five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon. The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north; it appeared to be a peaceful expedition, but they all carried arms hidden in their robes. When they reached the white tent at the center of Al-Fayoum, they withdrew their scimitars and rifles. And they attacked an empty tent.
The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead. The children had been kept at the other side of a grove of palm trees, and saw nothing of what had happened. The women had remained in their tents, praying for the safekeeping of their husbands, and saw nothing of the battle, either. Were it not for the bodies there on the ground, it would have appeared to be a normal day at the oasis.
The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion. That afternoon, he was brought before the tribal chieftains, who asked him why he had violated the Tradition. The commander said that his men had been starving and thirsty, exhausted from many
days of battle, and had decided to take the oasis so as to be able to return to the war.
The tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen, but that the Tradition was sacred. He condemned the commander to death without honor. Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet, he was hanged from a dead palm tree, where his body twisted in the desert wind.
The tribal chieftain called for the boy, and presented him with fifty pieces of gold. He repeated his story about Joseph of Egypt, and asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis.
WHEN THE SUN HAD SET, AND THE FIRST STARS MADE their appearance, the boy started to walk to the south. He eventually sighted a single tent, and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies. But the boy sat down and waited.
Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view. He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder.
“I am here,” the boy said.
“You shouldn’t be here,” the alchemist answered. “Or is it your Personal Legend that brings you here?”
“With the wars between the tribes, it’s impossible to cross the desert. So I have come here.”
The alchemist dismounted from his horse, and signaled that the boy should enter the tent with him. It was a tent like many at the oasis. The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy, but saw none. There were only some books in a pile, a small cooking stove, and the carpets, covered with mysterious designs.
“Sit down. We’ll have something to drink and eat these hawks,” said the alchemist.
The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen on the day before, but he said nothing. The alchemist lighted the fire, and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent. It was better than the scent of the hookahs.
“Why did you want to see me?” the boy asked.
“Because of the omens,” the alchemist answered. “The wind told me you would be coming, and that you would need help.”
“It’s not I the wind spoke about. It’s the other foreigner, the Englishman. He’s the one that’s looking for you.”
“He has other things to do first. But he’s on the right track. He has begun to try to understand the desert.”
“And what about me?”
“When a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream,” said the alchemist, echoing the words of the old king. The boy understood. Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend.
“So you are going to instruct me?”
“No. You already know all you need to know. I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure.”
“But there’s a tribal war,” the boy reiterated.
“I know what’s happening in the desert.”
“I have already found my treasure. I have a camel, I have my money from the crystal shop, and I have fifty gold pieces. In my own country, I would be a rich man.”
“But none of that is from the Pyramids,” said the alchemist.
“I also have Fatima. She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won.”
“She wasn’t found at the Pyramids, either.”
They ate in silence. The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy’s cup. It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted.
“Isn’t wine prohibited here?” the boy asked
“It’s not what enters men’s mouths that’s evil,” said the alchemist. “It’s what comes out of their mouths that is.”
The alchemist was a bit daunting, but, as the boy drank the wine, he relaxed. After they finished eating they sat outside the tent, under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale.
“Drink and enjoy yourself,” said the alchemist, noticing that the boy was feeling happier. “Rest well tonight, as if you were a warrior preparing for combat. Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure. You’ve got to find the treasure, so that everything you have learned along the way can make sense.
“Tomorrow, sell your camel and buy a horse. Camels are traitorous: they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire. Then suddenly, they kneel and die. But horses tire bit by bit. You always know how much you can ask of them, and when it is that they are about to die.”
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, THE BOY APPEARED AT THE alchemist’s tent with a horse. The alchemist was ready, and he mounted his own steed and placed the falcon on his left shoulder. He said to the boy, “Show me where there is life out in the desert. Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure.”
They began to ride out over the sands, with the moon lighting their way. I don’t know if I’ll be able to find life in the desert, the boy thought. I don’t know the desert that well yet.
He wanted to say so to the alchemist, but he was afraid of the man. They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the hawks in the sky, but now there was only silence and the wind.
“I don’t know how to find life in the desert,” the boy said. “I know that there is life here, but I don’t know where to look.”
“Life attracts life,” the alchemist answered.
And then the boy understood. He loosened the reins on his horse, who galloped forward over the rocks and sand. The alchemist followed as the boy’s horse ran for almost half an hour. They could no longer see the palms of the oasis—only the gigantic moon above them, and its silver reflections from the stones of the desert. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the boy’s horse began to slow.
“There’s life here,” the boy said to the alchemist. “I don’t know the language of the desert, but my horse knows the language of life.”
They dismounted, and the alchemist said nothing. Advancing slowly, they searched among the stones. The alchemist stopped abruptly, and bent to the ground. There was a hole there among the stones. The alchemist put his hand into the hole, and then his entire arm, up to his shoulder. Something was moving there, and the alchemist’s eyes—the boy could see only his eyes—squinted with his effort. His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole. Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his arm and leaped to his feet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail.
The boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist. The snake fought frantically, making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert. It was a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in minutes.
“Watch out for his venom,” the boy said. But even though the alchemist had put his hand in the hole, and had surely already been bitten, his expression was calm. “The alchemist is two hundred
years old,” the Englishman had told him. He must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert.
The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar. With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and then he placed the snake within it. The serpent relaxed immediately.
“Not to worry,” said the alchemist. “He won’t leave the circle. You found life in the desert, the omen that I needed.”
“Why was that so important?”
“Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert.”
The boy didn’t want to talk about the Pyramids. His heart was heavy, and he had been melancholy since the previous night. To continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima.
“I’m going to guide you across the desert,” the alchemist said.
“I want to stay at the oasis,” the boy answered. “I’ve found Fatima, and, as far as I’m concerned, she’s worth more than treasure.”
“Fatima is a woman of the desert,” said the alchemist. “She knows that men have to go away in order to return. And she already has her treasure: it’s you. Now she expects that you will find what it is you’re looking for.”
“Well, what if I decide to stay?”
“Let me tell you what will happen. You’ll be the counselor of the oasis. You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels. You’ll marry Fatima, and you’ll both be happy for a year. You’ll learn to love the desert, and you’ll get to know every one of the fifty thousand palms. You’ll watch them as they grow, demonstrating how the world is always changing. And you’ll get better and better at understanding omens, because the desert is the best teacher there is.
“Sometime during the second year, you’ll remember about the treasure. The omens will begin insistently to speak of it, and you’ll try to ignore them. You’ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants. The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do. And your camels will bring you wealth and power.
“During the third year, the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your Personal Legend. You’ll walk around, night after night, at the oasis, and Fatima will be unhappy because she’ll feel it was she who interrupted your quest. But you will love her, and she’ll return your love. You’ll remember that she never asked you to stay, because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man. So you won’t blame her. But many times you’ll walk the sands of the desert, thinking that maybe you could have left…that you could have trusted more in your love for Fatima. Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back. At that point, the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever.
“Then, sometime during the fourth year, the omens will abandon you, because you’ve stopped listening to them. The tribal chieftains will see that, and you’ll be dismissed from your position as counselor. But, by then, you’ll be a rich merchant, with many camels and a great deal of merchandise. You’ll spend the rest of your days knowing that you didn’t pursue your Personal Legend, and that now it’s too late.
“You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his Personal Legend. If he abandons that pursuit, it’s because it wasn’t true love…the love that speaks the Language of the World.”
The alchemist erased the circle in the sand, and the snake slithered away among the rocks. The boy remembered the crystal
merchant who had always wanted to go to Mecca, and the Englishman in search of the alchemist. He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert. And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved.
They mounted their horses, and this time it was the boy who followed the alchemist back to the oasis. The wind brought the sounds of the oasis to them, and the boy tried to hear Fatima’s voice.
But that night, as he had watched the cobra within the circle, the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of love and treasure, of the women of the desert and of his Personal Legend.
“I’m going with you,” the boy said. And he immediately felt peace in his heart.
“We’ll leave tomorrow before sunrise,” was the alchemist’s only response.
THE BOY SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT. TWO HOURS BEFORE dawn, he awoke one of the boys who slept in his tent, and asked him to show him where Fatima lived. They went to her tent, and the boy gave his friend enough gold to buy a sheep.
Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was sleeping, and to awaken her and tell her that he was waiting outside. The young Arab did as he was asked, and was given enough gold to buy yet another sheep.
“Now leave us alone,” said the boy to the young Arab. The Arab returned to his tent to sleep, proud to have helped the counselor of the oasis, and happy at having enough money to buy himself some sheep.
Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent. The two walked out among the palms. The boy knew that it was a violation of the Tradition, but that didn’t matter to him now.
“I’m going away,” he said. “And I want you to know that I’m coming back. I love you because…”
“Don’t say anything,” Fatima interrupted. “One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.”
But the boy continued, “I had a dream, and I met with a king. I sold crystal and crossed the desert. And, because the tribes declared war, I went to the well, seeking the alchemist. So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.”
The two embraced. It was the first time either had touched the other.
“I’ll be back,” the boy said.
“Before this, I always looked to the desert with longing,” said Fatima. “Now it will be with hope. My father went away one day, but he returned to my mother, and he has always come back since then.”
They said nothing else. They walked a bit farther among the palms, and then the boy left her at the entrance to her tent.
“I’ll return, just as your father came back to your mother,” he said.
He saw that Fatima’s eyes were filled with tears.
“You’re crying?”
“I’m a woman of the desert,” she said, averting her face. “But above all, I’m a woman.”
Fatima went back to her tent, and, when daylight came, she went out to do the chores she had done for years. But everything had changed. The boy was no longer at the oasis, and the oasis would never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday. It
would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three hundred wells, where the pilgrims arrived, relieved at the end of their long journeys. From that day on, the oasis would be an empty place for her.
From that day on, it was the desert that would be important. She would look to it every day, and would try to guess which star the boy was following in search of his treasure. She would have to send her kisses on the wind, hoping that the wind would touch the boy’s face, and would tell him that she was alive. That she was waiting for him, a woman awaiting a courageous man in search of his treasure. From that day on, the desert would represent only one thing to her: the hope for his return.
“DON’T THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU’VE LEFT BEHIND,” THE alchemist said to the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert. “Everything is written in the Soul of the World, and there it will stay forever.”
“Men dream more about coming home than about leaving,” the boy said. He was already reaccustomed to the desert’s silence.
“If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can always come back. If what you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return.”
The man was speaking the language of alchemy. But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima.
It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind. The desert, with its endless monotony, put him to dreaming. The boy could still see the palm trees, the wells, and the face of the woman
he loved. He could see the Englishman at his experiments, and the camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it. Maybe the alchemist has never been in love, the boy thought.
The alchemist rode in front, with the falcon on his shoulder. The bird knew the language of the desert well, and whenever they stopped, he flew off in search of game. On the first day he returned with a rabbit, and on the second with two birds.
At night, they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden. The desert nights were cold, and were becoming darker and darker as the phases of the moon passed. They went on for a week, speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to avoid the battles between the tribes. The war continued, and at times the wind carried the sweet, sickly smell of blood. Battles had been fought nearby, and the wind reminded the boy that there was the language of omens, always ready to show him what his eyes had failed to observe.
On the seventh day, the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual. The falcon flew off to find game, and the alchemist offered his water container to the boy.
“You are almost at the end of your journey,” said the alchemist. “I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend.”
“And you’ve told me nothing along the way,” said the boy. “I thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know. A while ago, I rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy. But I wasn’t able to learn anything from them.”
“There is only one way to learn,” the alchemist answered. “It’s through action. Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey. You need to learn only one thing more.”
The boy wanted to know what that was, but the alchemist was searching the horizon, looking for the falcon.
“Why are you called the alchemist?”
“Because that’s what I am.”
“And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so?”
“They were looking only for gold,” his companion answered. “They were seeking the treasure of their Personal Legend, without wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend.”
“What is it that I still need to know?” the boy asked.
But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon. And finally the falcon returned with their meal. They dug a hole and lit their fire in it, so that the light of the flames would not be seen.
“I’m an alchemist simply because I’m an alchemist,” he said, as he prepared the meal. “I learned the science from my grandfather, who learned from his father, and so on, back to the creation of the world. In those times, the Master Work could be written simply on an emerald. But men began to reject simple things, and to write tracts, interpretations, and philosophical studies. They also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had. Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today.”
“What was written on the Emerald Tablet?” the boy wanted to know.
The alchemist began to draw in the sand, and completed his drawing in less than five minutes. As he drew, the boy thought of the old king, and the plaza where they had met that day; it seemed as if it had taken place years and years ago.
“This is what was written on the Emerald Tablet,” said the alchemist, when he had finished.
The boy tried to read what was written in the sand.
“It’s a code,” said the boy, a bit disappointed. “It looks like what I saw in the Englishman’s books.”
“No,” the alchemist answered. “It’s like the flight of those two hawks; it can’t be understood by reason alone. The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World.
“The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise. The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect. God created the world so that, through its visible objects, men could understand his spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom. That’s what I mean by action.”
“Should I understand the Emerald Tablet?” the boy asked.
“Perhaps, if you were in a laboratory of alchemy, this would be the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet. But you are in the desert. So immerse yourself in it. The desert will give you an understanding of the world; in fact, anything on the face of the earth will do that. You don’t even have to understand the desert: all you have to do is contemplate a simple grain of sand, and you will see in it all the marvels of creation.”
“How do I immerse myself in the desert?”
“Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of the World, and it will one day return there.”
THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN silence. The alchemist had become much more cautious, because they were approaching the area where the most violent battles were being waged. As they moved along, the boy tried to listen to his heart.
It was not easy to do; in earlier times, his heart had always been ready to tell its story, but lately that wasn’t true. There had been times when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness, and at other
times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears. His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy of treasure, and more slowly when the boy stared entranced at the endless horizons of the desert. But his heart was never quiet, even when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence.
“Why do we have to listen to our hearts?” the boy asked, when they had made camp that day.
“Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you’ll find your treasure.”
“But my heart is agitated,” the boy said. “It has its dreams, it gets emotional, and it’s become passionate over a woman of the desert. It asks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when I’m thinking about her.”
“Well, that’s good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has to say.”
During the next three days, the two travelers passed by a number of armed tribesmen, and saw others on the horizon. The boy’s heart began to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard from the Soul of the World, stories of men who sought to find their treasure and never succeeded. Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that he might die there in the desert. At other times, it told the boy that it was satisfied: it had found love and riches.
“My heart is a traitor,” the boy said to the alchemist, when they had paused to rest the horses. “It doesn’t want me to go on.”
“That makes sense,” the alchemist answered. “Naturally it’s afraid that, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you’ve won.”
“Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?”
“Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there inside you, repeating to you what you’re thinking about life and about the world.”
“You mean I should listen, even if it’s treasonous?”
“Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your heart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you’ll know its dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them.
“You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it’s better to listen to what it has to say. That way, you’ll never have to fear an unanticipated blow.”
The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it as it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to the oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy. “Even though I complain sometimes,” it said, “it’s because I’m the heart of a person, and people’s hearts are that way. People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they don’t deserve them, or that they’ll be unable to achieve them. We, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go away forever, or of moments that could have been good but weren’t, or of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we suffer terribly.”
“My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,” the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky.
“Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second’s encounter with God and with eternity.”
“Every second of the search is an encounter with God,” the boy told his heart. “When I have been truly searching for my treasure, every day has been luminous, because I’ve known that every hour was a part of the dream that I would find it. When I have been truly searching for my treasure, I’ve discovered things along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve.”
So his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon. That night, the boy slept deeply, and, when he awoke, his heart began to tell him things that came from the Soul of the World. It said that all people who are happy have God within them. And that happiness could be found in a grain of sand from the desert, as the alchemist had said. Because a grain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe has taken millions of years to create it. “Everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him,” his heart said. “We, people’s hearts, seldom say much about those treasures, because people no longer want to go in search of them. We speak of them only to children. Later, we simply let life proceed, in its own direction, toward its own fate. But, unfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to their Personal Legends, and to happiness. Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place.
“So, we, their hearts, speak more and more softly. We never stop speaking out, but we begin to hope that our words won’t be heard: we don’t want people to suffer because they don’t follow their hearts.”
“Why don’t people’s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams?” the boy asked the alchemist.
“Because that’s what makes a heart suffer most, and hearts don’t like to suffer.”
From then on, the boy understood his heart. He asked it, please, never to stop speaking to him. He asked that, when he wandered far from his dreams, his heart press him and sound the alarm. The boy swore that, every time he heard the alarm, he would heed its message.
That night, he told all of this to the alchemist. And the alchemist understood that the boy’s heart had returned to the Soul of the World.
“So what should I do now?” the boy asked.
“Continue in the direction of the Pyramids,” said the alchemist. “And continue to pay heed to the omens. Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is.”
“Is that the one thing I still needed to know?”
“No,” the alchemist answered. “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which most people give up. It’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’
“Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”
The boy remembered an old proverb from his country. It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE FIRST CLEAR SIGN OF danger appeared. Three armed tribesmen approached, and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there.
“I’m hunting with my falcon,” the alchemist answered.
“We’re going to have to search you to see whether you’re armed,” one of the tribesmen said.
The alchemist dismounted slowly, and the boy did the same.
“Why are you carrying money?” asked the tribesman, when he had searched the boy’s bag.
“I need it to get to the Pyramids,” he said.
The tribesman who was searching the alchemist’s belongings found a small crystal flask filled with a liquid, and a yellow glass egg that was slightly larger than a chicken’s egg.
“What are these things?” he asked.
“That’s the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life. It’s the Master Work of the alchemists. Whoever swallows that elixir will never be sick again, and a fragment from that stone turns any metal into gold.”
The Arabs laughed at him, and the alchemist laughed along. They thought his answer was amusing, and they allowed the boy and the alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings.
“Are you crazy?” the boy asked the alchemist, when they had moved on. “What did you do that for?”
“To show you one of life’s simple lessons,” the alchemist answered. “When you possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.”
They continued across the desert. With every day that passed, the boy’s heart became more and more silent. It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future; it was content simply to contemplate the desert, and to drink with the boy from the Soul of
the World. The boy and his heart had become friends, and neither was capable now of betraying the other.
When his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a stimulus to the boy, and to give him strength, because the days of silence there in the desert were wearisome. His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were: his courage in having given up his sheep and in trying to live out his Personal Legend, and his enthusiasm during the time he had worked at the crystal shop.
And his heart told him something else that the boy had never noticed: it told the boy of dangers that had threatened him, but that he had never perceived. His heart said that one time it had hidden the rifle the boy had taken from his father, because of the possibility that the boy might wound himself. And it reminded the boy of the day when he had been ill and vomiting out in the fields, after which he had fallen into a deep sleep. There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy’s sheep and murder him. But, since the boy hadn’t passed by, they had decided to move on, thinking that he had changed his route.
“Does a man’s heart always help him?” the boy asked the alchemist.
“Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their Personal Legends. But they do help children, drunkards, and the elderly, too.”
“Does that mean that I’ll never run into danger?”
“It means only that the heart does what it can,” the alchemist said.
One afternoon, they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes. At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful white robes, with arms at the ready. The men were smoking their
hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield. No one paid any attention to the two travelers.
“There’s no danger,” the boy said, when they had moved on past the encampment.
The alchemist sounded angry: “Trust in your heart, but never forget that you’re in the desert. When men are at war with one another, the Soul of the World can hear the screams of battle. No one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun.”
All things are one, the boy thought. And then, as if the desert wanted to demonstrate that the alchemist was right, two horsemen appeared from behind the travelers.
“You can’t go any farther,” one of them said. “You’re in the area where the tribes are at war.”
“I’m not going very far,” the alchemist answered, looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen. They were silent for a moment, and then agreed that the boy and the alchemist could move along.
The boy watched the exchange with fascination. “You dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them,” he said.
“Your eyes show the strength of your soul,” answered the alchemist.
That’s true, the boy thought. He had noticed that, in the midst of the multitude of armed men back at the encampment, there had been one who stared fixedly at the two. He had been so far away that his face wasn’t even visible. But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them.
Finally, when they had crossed the mountain range that extended along the entire horizon, the alchemist said that they were only two days from the Pyramids.
“If we’re going to go our separate ways soon,” the boy said, “then teach me about alchemy.”
“You already know about alchemy. It is about penetrating to the Soul of the World, and discovering the treasure that has been reserved for you.”
“No, that’s not what I mean. I’m talking about transforming lead into gold.”
The alchemist fell as silent as the desert, and answered the boy only after they had stopped to eat.
“Everything in the universe evolved,” he said. “And, for wise men, gold is the metal that evolved the furthest. Don’t ask me why; I don’t know why. I just know that the Tradition is always right.
“Men have never understood the words of the wise. So gold, instead of being seen as a symbol of evolution, became the basis for conflict.”
“There are many languages spoken by things,” the boy said. “There was a time when, for me, a camel’s whinnying was nothing more than whinnying. Then it became a signal of danger. And, finally, it became just a whinny again.”
But then he stopped. The alchemist probably already knew all that.
“I have known true alchemists,” the alchemist continued. “They locked themselves in their laboratories, and tried to evolve, as gold had. And they found the Philosopher’s Stone, because they understood that when something evolves, everything around that thing evolves as well.
“Others stumbled upon the stone by accident. They already had the gift, and their souls were readier for such things than the souls of others. But they don’t count. They’re quite rare.
“And then there were the others, who were interested only in gold. They never found the secret. They forgot that lead, copper, and iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill. And anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own.”
The alchemist’s words echoed out like a curse. He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground.
“This desert was once a sea,” he said.
“I noticed that,” the boy answered.
The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear. He had done that many times when he was a child, and had heard the sound of the sea.
“The sea has lived on in this shell, because that’s its Personal Legend. And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water.”
They mounted their horses, and rode out in the direction of the Pyramids of Egypt.
THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THE BOY’S HEART SOUNDED a danger signal. They were surrounded by gigantic dunes, and the boy looked at the alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything. But he appeared to be unaware of any danger. Five minutes later, the boy saw two horsemen waiting ahead of them. Before he could say anything to the alchemist, the two horsemen had become ten, and then a hundred. And then they were everywhere in the dunes.
They were tribesmen dressed in blue, with black rings surrounding their turbans. Their faces were hidden behind blue veils, with only their eyes showing.
Even from a distance, their eyes conveyed the strength of their souls. And their eyes spoke of death.
THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP. A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff.
“These are the spies,” said one of the men.
“We’re just travelers,” the alchemist answered.
“You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago. And you were talking with one of the troops there.”
“I’m just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars,” said the alchemist. “I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes. I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here.”
“Who is your friend?” the chief asked.
“An alchemist,” said the alchemist. “He understands the forces of nature. And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers.”
The boy listened quietly. And fearfully.
“What is a foreigner doing here?” asked another of the men.
“He has brought money to give to your tribe,” said the alchemist, before the boy could say a word. And seizing the boy’s bag, the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief.
The Arab accepted them without a word. There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons.
“What is an alchemist?” he asked, finally.
“It’s a man who understands nature and the world. If he wanted to, he could destroy this camp just with the force of the wind.”
The men laughed. They were used to the ravages of war, and knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow. Yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster. They were men of the desert, and they were fearful of sorcerers.
“I want to see him do it,” said the chief.
“He needs three days,” answered the alchemist. “He is going to transform himself into the wind, just to demonstrate his powers. If he can’t do so, we humbly offer you our lives, for the honor of your tribe.”
“You can’t offer me something that is already mine,” the chief said, arrogantly. But he granted the travelers three days.
The boy was shaking with fear, but the alchemist helped him out of the tent.
“Don’t let them see that you’re afraid,” the alchemist said. “They are brave men, and they despise cowards.”
But the boy couldn’t even speak. He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp. There was no need to imprison them: the Arabs simply confiscated their horses. So, once again, the world had demonstrated its many languages: the desert only moments ago had been endless and free, and now it was an impenetrable wall.
“You gave them everything I had!” the boy said. “Everything I’ve saved in my entire life!”
“Well, what good would it be to you if you had to die?” the alchemist answered. “Your money saved us for three days. It’s not often that money saves a person’s life.”
But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom. He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind. He wasn’t an alchemist!
The alchemist asked one of the soldiers for some tea, and poured some on the boy’s wrists. A wave of relief washed over him, and the alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn’t understand.
“Don’t give in to your fears,” said the alchemist, in a strangely gentle voice. “If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.”
“But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind.”
“If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows everything he needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.”
“I’m not afraid of failing. It’s just that I don’t know how to turn myself into the wind.”
“Well, you’ll have to learn; your life depends on it.”
“But what if I can’t?”
“Then you’ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal Legend. That’s a lot better than dying like millions of other people, who never even knew what their Personal Legends were.
“But don’t worry,” the alchemist continued. “Usually the threat of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives.”
THE FIRST DAY PASSED. THERE WAS A MAJOR BATTLE nearby, and a number of wounded were brought back to the camp. The dead soldiers were replaced by others, and life went on. Death doesn’t change anything, the boy thought.
“You could have died later on,” a soldier said to the body of one of his companions. “You could have died after peace had been declared. But, in any case, you were going to die.”
At the end of the day, the boy went looking for the alchemist, who had taken his falcon out into the desert.
“I still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind,” the boy repeated.
“Remember what I told you: the world is only the visible aspect of God. And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane.”
“What are you doing?”
“Feeding my falcon.”
“If I’m not able to turn myself into the wind, we’re going to die,” the boy said. “Why feed your falcon?”
“You’re the one who may die,” the alchemist said. “I already know how to turn myself into the wind.”
ON THE SECOND DAY, THE BOY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A cliff near the camp. The sentinels allowed him to go; they had already heard about the sorcerer who could turn himself into the wind, and they didn’t want to go near him. In any case, the desert was impassable.
He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over the desert, and listening to his heart. The boy knew the desert sensed his fear.
They both spoke the same language.
ON THE THIRD DAY, THE CHIEF MET WITH HIS OFFICERS. He called the alchemist to the meeting and said, “Let’s go see the boy who turns himself into the wind.”
“Let’s,” the alchemist answered.
The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day. He told them all to be seated.
“It’s going to take awhile,” the boy said.
“We’re in no hurry,” the chief answered. “We are men of the desert.”
The boy looked out at the horizon. There were mountains in the distance. And there were dunes, rocks, and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible. There was the desert that he had wandered for so many months; despite all that time, he knew only a small part of it. Within that small part, he had found an Englishman, caravans, tribal wars, and an oasis with fifty thousand palm trees and three hundred wells.
“What do you want here today?” the desert asked him. “Didn’t you spend enough time looking at me yesterday?”
“Somewhere you are holding the person I love,” the boy said. “So, when I look out over your sands, I am also looking at her. I want to return to her, and I need your help so that I can turn myself into the wind.”
“What is love?” the desert asked.
“Love is the falcon’s flight over your sands. Because for him, you are a green field, from which he always returns with game. He knows your rocks, your dunes, and your mountains, and you are generous to him.”
“The falcon’s beak carries bits of me, myself,” the desert said. “For years, I care for his game, feeding it with the little water that I have, and then I show him where the game is. And, one day, as I enjoy the fact that his game thrives on my surface, the falcon dives out of the sky, and takes away what I’ve created.”
“But that’s why you created the game in the first place,” the boy answered. “To nourish the falcon. And the falcon then nourishes
man. And, eventually, man will nourish your sands, where the game will once again flourish. That’s how the world goes.”
“So is that what love is?”
“Yes, that’s what love is. It’s what makes the game become the falcon, the falcon become man, and man, in his turn, the desert. It’s what turns lead into gold, and makes the gold return to the earth.”
“I don’t understand what you’re talking about,” the desert said.
“But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me. And that’s why I have to turn myself into the wind.”
The desert didn’t answer him for a few moments.
Then it told him, “I’ll give you my sands to help the wind to blow, but, alone, I can’t do anything. You have to ask for help from the wind.”
A breeze began to blow. The tribesmen watched the boy from a distance, talking among themselves in a language that the boy couldn’t understand.
The alchemist smiled.
The wind approached the boy and touched his face. It knew of the boy’s talk with the desert, because the winds know everything. They blow across the world without a birthplace, and with no place to die.
“Help me,” the boy said. “One day you carried the voice of my loved one to me.”
“Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind?”
“My heart,” the boy answered.
The wind has many names. In that part of the world, it was called the sirocco, because it brought moisture from the oceans to the east. In the distant land the boy came from, they called it the
levanter, because they believed that it brought with it the sands of the desert, and the screams of the Moorish wars. Perhaps, in the places beyond the pastures where his sheep lived, men thought that the wind came from Andalusia. But, actually, the wind came from no place at all, nor did it go to any place; that’s why it was stronger than the desert. Someone might one day plant trees in the desert, and even raise sheep there, but never would they harness the wind.
“You can’t be the wind,” the wind said. “We’re two very different things.”
“That’s not true,” the boy said. “I learned the alchemist’s secrets in my travels. I have inside me the winds, the deserts, the oceans, the stars, and everything created in the universe. We were all made by the same hand, and we have the same soul. I want to be like you, able to reach every corner of the world, cross the seas, blow away the sands that cover my treasure, and carry the voice of the woman I love.”
“I heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist,” the wind said. “He said that everything has its own Personal Legend. But people can’t turn themselves into the wind.”
“Just teach me to be the wind for a few moments,” the boy said. “So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds.”
The wind’s curiosity was aroused, something that had never happened before. It wanted to talk about those things, but it didn’t know how to turn a man into the wind. And look how many things the wind already knew how to do! It created deserts, sank ships, felled entire forests, and blew through cities filled with music and strange noises. It felt that it had no limits, yet here was a boy saying that there were other things the wind should be able to do.
“This is what we call love,” the boy said, seeing that the wind was close to granting what he requested. “When you are loved, you can do anything in creation. When you are loved, there’s no need at all to understand what’s happening, because everything happens within you, and even men can turn themselves into the wind. As long as the wind helps, of course.”
The wind was a proud being, and it was becoming irritated with what the boy was saying. It commenced to blow harder, raising the desert sands. But finally it had to recognize that, even making its may around the world, it didn’t know how to turn a man into the wind. And it knew nothing about love.
“In my travels around the world, I’ve often seen people speaking of love and looking toward the heavens,” the wind said, furious at having to acknowledge its own limitations. “Maybe it’s better to ask heaven.”
“Well then, help me do that,” the boy said. “Fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun. Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself.”
So the wind blew with all its strength, and the sky was filled with sand. The sun was turned into a golden disk.
At the camp, it was difficult to see anything. The men of the desert were already familiar with that wind. They called it the simum, and it was worse than a storm at sea. Their horses cried out, and all their weapons were filled with sand.
On the heights, one of the commanders turned to the chief and said, “Maybe we had better end this!”
They could barely see the boy. Their faces were covered with the blue cloths, and their eyes showed fear.
“Let’s stop this,” another commander said.
“I want to see the greatness of Allah,” the chief said, with respect. “I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind.”
But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had expressed their fear. As soon as the wind stopped, he was going to remove them from their commands, because true men of the desert are not afraid.
“The wind told me that you know about love,” the boy said to the sun. “If you know about love, you must also know about the Soul of the World, because it’s made of love.”
“From where I am,” the sun said, “I can see the Soul of the World. It communicates with my soul, and together we cause the plants to grow and the sheep to seek out shade. From where I am—and I’m a long way from the earth—I learned how to love. I know that if I came even a little bit closer to the earth, everything there would die, and the Soul of the World would no longer exist. So we contemplate each other, and we want each other, and I give it life and warmth, and it gives me my reason for living.”
“So you know about love,” the boy said.
“And I know the Soul of the World, because we have talked at great length to each other during this endless trip through the universe. It tells me that its greatest problem is that, up until now, only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one. That there’s no need for iron to be the same as copper, or copper the same as gold. Each performs its own exact function as a unique being, and everything would be a symphony of peace if the hand that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation.
“But there was a sixth day,” the sun went on.
“You are wise, because you observe everything from a distance,” the boy said. “But you don’t know about love. If there hadn’t been a sixth day, man would not exist; copper would always be just copper,
and lead just lead. It’s true that everything has its Personal Legend, but one day that Personal Legend will be realized. So each thing has to transform itself into something better, and to acquire a new Personal Legend, until, someday, the Soul of the World becomes one thing only.”
The sun thought about that, and decided to shine more brightly. The wind, which was enjoying the conversation, started to blow with greater force, so that the sun would not blind the boy.
“This is why alchemy exists,” the boy said. “So that everyone will search for his treasure, find it, and then want to be better than he was in his former life. Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead; and then lead will have to turn itself into gold.
“That’s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.”
“Well, why did you say that I don’t know about love?” the sun asked the boy.
“Because it’s not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to roam the world like the wind. And it’s not love to see everything from a distance, like you do. Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World. When I first reached through to it, I thought the Soul of the World was perfect. But later, I could see that it was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and wars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the World, and the world we live in will be either better or worse, depending on whether we become better or worse. And that’s where the power of love comes in. Because when we love, we always strive to become better than we are.”
“So what do you want of me?” the sun asked.
“I want you to help me turn myself into the wind,” the boy answered.
“Nature knows me as the wisest being in creation,” the sun said. “But I don’t know how to turn you into the wind.”
“Then, whom should I ask?”
The sun thought for a minute. The wind was listening closely, and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun’s wisdom had its limitations. That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World.
“Speak to the hand that wrote all,” said the sun.
The wind screamed with delight, and blew harder than ever. The tents were being blown from their ties to the earth, and the animals were being freed from their tethers. On the cliff, the men clutched at each other as they sought to keep from being blown away.
The boy turned to the hand that wrote all. As he did so, he sensed that the universe had fallen silent, and he decided not to speak.
A current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to pray. It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a prayer without words or pleas. His prayer didn’t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures; it didn’t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal; and it didn’t beseech that the woman he had met continue to await his return. In the silence, the boy understood that the desert, the wind, and the sun were also trying to understand the signs written by the hand, and were seeking to follow their paths, and to understand what had been written on a single emerald. He saw that omens were scattered throughout the earth and in space, and that there was no reason or significance attached to their appearance; he could see that not the deserts, nor the winds, nor the sun, nor people knew why they had been created.
But that the hand had a reason for all of this, and that only the hand could perform miracles, or transform the sea into a desert…or a man into the wind. Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work.
The boy reached through to the Soul of the World, and saw that it was a part of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was his own soul. And that he, a boy, could perform miracles.
THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN before. For generations thereafter, the Arabs recounted the legend of a boy who had turned himself into the wind, almost destroying a military camp, in defiance of the most powerful chief in the desert.
When the simum ceased to blow, everyone looked to the place where the boy had been. But he was no longer there; he was standing next to a sand-covered sentinel, on the far side of the camp.
The men were terrified at his sorcery. But there were two people who were smiling: the alchemist, because he had found his perfect disciple, and the chief, because that disciple had understood the glory of God.
The following day, the general bade the boy and the alchemist farewell, and provided them with an escort party to accompany them as far as they chose.
THEY RODE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. TOWARD THE END OF the afternoon, they came upon a Coptic monastery. The alchemist dismounted, and told the escorts they could return to the camp.
“From here on, you will be alone,” the alchemist said. “You are only three hours from the Pyramids.”
“Thank you,” said the boy. “You taught me the Language of the World.”
“I only invoked what you already knew.”
The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery. A monk dressed in black came to the gates. They spoke for a few minutes in the Coptic tongue, and the alchemist bade the boy enter.
“I asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while,” the alchemist smiled.
They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery. The alchemist lighted the fire, and the monk brought him some lead, which the alchemist placed in an iron pan. When the lead had become liquid, the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg. He scraped from it a sliver as thin as a hair, wrapped it in wax, and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted.
The mixture took on a reddish color, almost the color of blood. The alchemist removed the pan from the fire, and set it aside to cool. As he did so, he talked with the monk about the tribal wars.
“I think they’re going to last for a long time,” he said to the monk.
The monk was irritated. The caravans had been stopped at Giza for some time, waiting for the wars to end. “But God’s will be done,” the monk said.
“Exactly,” answered the alchemist.
When the pan had cooled, the monk and the boy looked at it, dazzled. The lead had dried into the shape of the pan, but it was no longer lead. It was gold.
“Will I learn to do that someday?” the boy asked.
“This was my Personal Legend, not yours,” the alchemist answered. “But I wanted to show you that it was possible.”
They returned to the gates of the monastery. There, the alchemist separated the disk into four parts.
“This is for you,” he said, holding one of the parts out to the monk. “It’s for your generosity to the pilgrims.”
“But this payment goes well beyond my generosity,” the monk responded.
“Don’t say that again. Life might be listening, and give you less the next time.”
The alchemist turned to the boy. “This is for you. To make up for what you gave to the general.”
The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had given the general. But he kept quiet, because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk.
“And this is for me,” said the alchemist, keeping one of the parts. “Because I have to return to the desert, where there are tribal wars.”
He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk.
“This is for the boy. If he ever needs it.”
“But I’m going in search of my treasure,” the boy said. “I’m very close to it now.”
“And I’m certain you’ll find it,” the alchemist said.
“Then why this?”
“Because you have already lost your savings twice. Once to the thief, and once to the general. I’m an old, superstitious Arab, and I believe in our proverbs. There’s one that says, ‘Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.’” They mounted their horses.
“I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT DREAMS,” SAID THE alchemist.
The boy brought his horse closer.
“In ancient Rome, at the time of Emperor Tiberius, there lived a good man who had two sons. One was in the military, and had been sent to the most distant regions of the empire. The other son was a poet, and delighted all of Rome with his beautiful verses.
“One night, the father had a dream. An angel appeared to him, and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come. The father woke from his dream grateful and crying, because life was generous, and had revealed to him something any father would be proud to know.
“Shortly thereafter, the father died as he tried to save a child who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot. Since he had lived his entire life in a manner that was correct and fair, he went directly to heaven, where he met the angel that had appeared in his dream.
“‘You were always a good man,’ the angel said to him. ‘You lived your life in a loving way, and died with dignity. I can now grant you any wish you desire.’
“‘Life was good to me,’ the man said. ‘When you appeared in my dream, I felt that all my efforts had been rewarded, because my son’s poems will be read by men for generations to come. I don’t want anything for myself. But any father would be proud of the fame achieved by one whom he had cared for as a child, and educated as he grew up. Sometime in the distant future, I would like to see my son’s words.’
“The angel touched the man’s shoulder, and they were both projected far into the future. They were in an immense setting, surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language.
“The man wept with happiness.
“‘I knew that my son’s poems were immortal,’ he said to the angel through his tears. ‘Can you please tell me which of my son’s poems these people are repeating?’
“The angel came closer to the man, and, with tenderness, led him to a bench nearby, where they sat down.
“‘The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in Rome,’ the angel said. ‘Everyone loved them and enjoyed them. But when the reign of Tiberius ended, his poems were forgotten. The words you’re hearing now are those of your son in the military.’
“The man looked at the angel in surprise.
“‘Your son went to serve at a distant place, and became a centurion. He was just and good. One afternoon, one of his servants fell ill, and it appeared that he would die. Your son had heard of a rabbi who was able to cure illnesses, and he rode out for days and days in search of this man. Along the way, he learned that the man he was seeking was the Son of God. He met others who had been cured by him, and they instructed your son in the man’s teachings. And so, despite the fact that he was a Roman centurion, he converted to their faith. Shortly thereafter, he reached the place where the man he was looking for was visiting.’
“‘He told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill, and the rabbi made ready to go to his house with him. But the centurion was a man of faith, and, looking into the eyes of the rabbi, he knew that he was surely in the presence of the Son of God.’
“‘And this is what your son said,’ the angel told the man. ‘These are the words he said to the rabbi at that point, and they have never
been forgotten: “My Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. But only speak a word and my servant will be healed.””’
The alchemist said, “No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn’t know it.”
The boy smiled. He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd.
“Good-bye,” the alchemist said.
“Good-bye,” said the boy.
THE BOY RODE ALONG THROUGH THE DESERT FOR SEVERAL hours, listening avidly to what his heart had to say. It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden.
“Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,” the alchemist had told him.
But his heart was speaking of other things. With pride, it told the story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had on two different occasions. It told of Personal Legend, and of the many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful women, confronting the people of their times with their preconceived notions. It spoke of journeys, discoveries, books, and change.
As he was about to climb yet another dune, his heart whispered, “Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears. That’s where I am, and that’s where your treasure is.”
The boy climbed the dune slowly. A full moon rose again in the starry sky: it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis.
The moonlight cast shadows through the dunes, creating the appearance of a rolling sea; it reminded the boy of the day when that horse had reared in the desert, and he had come to know the alchemist. And the moon fell on the desert’s silence, and on a man’s journey in search of treasure.
When he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt. There, illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the desert, stood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt.
The boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making him believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to meet a king, a merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist. And above all for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend.
If he wanted to, he could now return to the oasis, go back to Fatima, and live his life as a simple shepherd. After all, the alchemist continued to live in the desert, even though he understood the Language of the World, and knew how to transform lead into gold. He didn’t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone. The boy told himself that, on the way toward realizing his own Personal Legend, he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced everything he might have dreamed of.
But here he was, at the point of finding his treasure, and he reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has been achieved. The boy looked at the sands around him, and saw that, where his tears had fallen, a scarab beetle was scuttling through the sand. During his time in the desert, he had learned that, in Egypt, the scarab beetles are a symbol of God.
Another omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so, he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone
could build a pyramid in his backyard. The boy could see now that he couldn’t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life.
Throughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, but found nothing. He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built. But he didn’t stop. He struggled to continue digging as he fought the wind, which often blew the sand back into the excavation. His hands were abraded and exhausted, but he listened to his heart. It had told him to dig where his tears fell.
As he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered, he heard footsteps. Several figures approached him. Their backs were to the moonlight, and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their faces.
“What are you doing here?” one of the figures demanded.
Because he was terrified, the boy didn’t answer. He had found where his treasure was, and was frightened at what might happen.
“We’re refugees from the tribal wars, and we need money,” the other figure said. “What are you hiding there?”
“I’m not hiding anything,” the boy answered.
But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole. Another, who was searching the boy’s bags, found the piece of gold.
“There’s gold here,” he said.
The moon shone on the face of the Arab who had seized him, and in the man’s eyes the boy saw death.
“He’s probably got more gold hidden in the ground.”
They made the boy continue digging, but he found nothing. As the sun rose, the men began to beat the boy. He was bruised and bleeding, his clothing was torn to shreds, and he felt that death was near.
“What good is money to you if you’re going to die? It’s not often that money can save someone’s life,” the alchemist had said. Finally, the boy screamed at the men, “I’m digging for treasure!” And, although his mouth was bleeding and swollen, he told his attackers that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt.
The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others: “Leave him. He doesn’t have anything else. He must have stolen this gold.”
The boy fell to the sand, nearly unconscious. The leader shook him and said, “We’re leaving.”
But before they left, he came back to the boy and said, “You’re not going to die. You’ll live, and you’ll learn that a man shouldn’t be so stupid. Two years ago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent dream, too. I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept. In my dream, there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the sacristy, and I was told that, if I dug at the roots of the sycamore, I would find a hidden treasure. But I’m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream.”
And they disappeared.
The boy stood up shakily, and looked once more at the Pyramids. They seemed to laugh at him, and he laughed back, his heart bursting with joy.
Because now he knew where his treasure was.
EPILOGUE
THE BOY REACHED THE SMALL, ABANDONED CHURCH JUST as night was falling. The sycamore was still there in the sacristy, and the stars could still be seen through the half-destroyed roof. He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep; it had been a peaceful night…except for the dream.
Now he was here not with his flock, but with a shovel.
He sat looking at the sky for a long time. Then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine, and drank some. He remembered the night in the desert when he had sat with the alchemist, as they looked at the stars and drank wine together. He thought of the many roads he had traveled, and of the strange way God had chosen to show him his treasure. If he hadn’t believed in the significance of recurrent dreams, he would not have met the Gypsy woman, the king, the thief, or…“Well, it’s a long list. But the path was written in the omens, and there was no way I could go wrong,” he said to himself.
He fell asleep, and when he awoke the sun was already high. He began to dig at the base of the sycamore.
“You old sorcerer,” the boy shouted up to the sky. “You knew the whole story. You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church. The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters. Couldn’t you have saved me from that?”
“No,” he heard a voice on the wind say. “If I had told you, you wouldn’t have seen the Pyramids. They’re beautiful, aren’t they?”
The boy smiled, and continued digging. Half an hour later, his shovel hit something solid. An hour later, he had before him a chest of Spanish gold coins. There were also precious stones, gold masks adorned with red and white feathers, and stone statues embedded with jewels. The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago forgotten, and that some conquistador had failed to tell his children about.
The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag. He had used the two stones only once, one morning when he was at a marketplace. His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens.
He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest. They were also a part of his new treasure, because they were a reminder of the old king, whom he would never see again.
It’s true; life really is generous to those who pursue their Personal Legend, the boy thought. Then he remembered that he had to get to Tarifa so he could give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy woman, as he had promised. Those Gypsies are really smart, he thought. Maybe it was because they moved around so much.
The wind began to blow again. It was the levanter, the wind that came from Africa. It didn’t bring with it the smell of the desert, nor the threat of Moorish invasion. Instead, it brought the scent of a perfume he knew well, and the touch of a kiss—a kiss that came from far away, slowly, slowly, until it rested on his lips.
The boy smiled. It was the first time she had done that.
“I’m coming, Fatima,” he said.

TEN YEARS ON
I REMEMBER RECEIVING A LETTER FROM THE AMERICAN publisher Harper Collins that said that: “reading The Alchemist was like getting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept.” I went outside, looked up at the sky, and thought to myself: “So, the book is going to be published in English!” At the time, I was struggling to establish myself as a writer and to follow my path despite all the voices telling me it was impossible.
And little by little, my dream was becoming reality. Ten, a hundred, a thousand, a million copies sold in America. One day, a Brazilian journalist phoned to say that President Clinton had been photographed reading the book. Some time later, when I was in Turkey, I opened the magazine Vanity Fair and there was Julia Roberts declaring that she adored the book. Walking alone down a street in Miami, I heard a girl telling her mother: “You must read The Alchemist!”
The book has been translated into fifty-six languages, has sold more than twenty million copies, and people are beginning to ask: What’s the secret behind such a huge success?
The only honest response is: I don’t know. All I know is that, like Santiago the shepherd boy, we all need to be aware of our personal calling. What is a personal calling? It is God’s blessing, it is the path that God chose for you here on Earth. Whenever we do something that fills us with enthusiasm, we are following our legend. However, we don’t all have the courage to confront our own dream.
Why?
There are four obstacles. First: we are told from childhood onward that everything we want to do is impossible. We grow up with this idea, and as the years accumulate, so too do the layers of prejudice, fear, and guilt. There comes a time when our personal calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be invisible. But it’s still there.
If we have the courage to disinter dream, we are then faced by the second obstacle: love. We know what we want to do, but are afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in order to pursue our dream. We do not realize that love is just a further impetus, not something that will prevent us going forward. We do not realize that those who genuinely wish us well want us to be happy and are prepared to accompany us on that journey.
Once we have accepted that love is a stimulus, we come up against the third obstacle: fear of the defeats we will meet on the path. We who fight for our dream, suffer far more when it doesn’t work out, because we cannot fall back on the old excuse: “Oh, well, I didn’t really want it anyway.” We do want it and know that we have staked everything on it and that the path of the personal calling is no easier than any other path, except that our whole heart is in this journey. Then, we warriors of light must be prepared to have patience in difficult times and to know that the Universe is conspiring in our favor, even though we may not understand how.
I ask myself: are defeats necessary?
Well, necessary or not, they happen. When we first begin fighting for our dream, we have no experience and make many mistakes. The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.
So, why is it so important to live our personal calling if we are only going to suffer more than other people?
Because, once we have overcome the defeats—and we always do—we are filled by a greater sense of euphoria and confidence. In the silence of our hearts, we know that we are proving ourselves worthy of the miracle of life. Each day, each hour, is part of the good fight. We start to live with enthusiasm and pleasure. Intense, unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is apparently bearable; the latter goes on for years and, without our noticing, eats away at our soul, until, one day, we are no longer able to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest of our lives.
Having disinterred our dream, having used the power of love to nurture it and spent many years living with the scars, we suddenly notice that what we always wanted is there, waiting for us, perhaps the very next day. Then comes the fourth obstacle: the fear of realizing the dream for which we fought all our lives.
Oscar Wilde said: “Each man kills the thing he loves.” And it’s true. The mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of the ordinary person with guilt. We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either. We forget about all the obstacles we overcame, all the suffering we endured, all the things we had to give up in order to get this far. I have known a lot of people who, when their personal calling was within their grasp, went on to commit a series of stupid mistakes and never reached their goal—when it was only a step away.
This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind of saintly aura about it: renouncing joy and conquest. But if you believe yourself worthy of the thing you fought so hard to get, then
you become an instrument of God, you help the Soul of the World, and you understand why you are here.

PROLOGUE
Translated by Clifford E. Landers
THE ALCHEMIST PICKED UP A BOOK THAT SOMEONE IN THE caravan had brought. Leafing through the pages, he found a story about Narcissus.
The alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth who knelt daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty. He was so fascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell into the lake and drowned. At the spot where he fell, a flower was born, which was called the narcissus.
But this was not how the author of the book ended the story.
He said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest appeared and found the lake, which had been fresh water, transformed into a lake of salty tears.
“Why do you weep?” the goddesses asked.
“I weep for Narcissus,” the lake replied.
“Ah, it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus,” they said, “for though we always pursued him in the forest, you alone could contemplate his beauty close at hand.”
“But…was Narcissus beautiful?” the lake asked.
“Who better than you to know that?” the goddesses said in wonder. “After all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to contemplate himself!”
The lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said:
“I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.”
“What a lovely story,” the alchemist thought.
PART ONE
THE BOY’S NAME WAS SANTIAGO. DUSK WAS FALLING AS the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once stood.
He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night. There were no wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend the entire next day searching for it.
He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would have to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable pillows.
It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars through the half-destroyed roof.
I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended.
He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still slept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them through the countryside in search of food and water. “They are so used to me that they know my schedule,” he muttered. Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it
could be the other way around: that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule.
But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy prodded them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by name. He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said. So there were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an impression on him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields. Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed.
But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the girl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only once, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the boy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.
“I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL,” THE BOY TOLD THE merchant.
The shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon. So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag.
“I didn’t know shepherds knew how to read,” said a girl’s voice behind him.
The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia, with flowing black hair, and eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors.
“Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books,” he answered. During the two hours that they talked, she told him she
was the merchant’s daughter, and spoke of life in the village, where each day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the Andalusian countryside, and related the news from the other towns where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep.
“How did you learn to read?” the girl asked at one point.
“Like everybody learns,” he said. “In school.”
“Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?”
The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question. He was sure the girl would never understand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her bright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise. As the time passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days. He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again.
But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep. He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year.
AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE back in that same village. He was excited, and at the same time uneasy: maybe the girl had already forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling their wool.
“It doesn’t matter,” he said to his sheep. “I know other girls in other places.”
But in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that shepherds, like seamen and like traveling salesmen, always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering.
The day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun. They never have to make any decisions, he thought. Maybe that’s why they always stay close to me.
The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives, and didn’t understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content with just food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of their wool, their company, and—once in a while—their meat.
If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one, they would become aware only after most of the flock had been slaughtered, thought the boy. They trust me, and they’ve forgotten how to rely on their own instincts, because I lead them to nourishment.
The boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with the sycamore growing from within, had been haunted. It had caused him to have the same dream for a second time, and it was causing him to feel anger toward his faithful companions. He drank a bit from the wine that remained from his dinner of the night before, and he gathered his jacket closer to his body. He knew that a few hours from now, with the sun at its zenith, the heat would be so great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields. It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer. The heat lasted until nightfall, and all that time he had to carry his
jacket. But when he thought to complain about the burden of its weight, he remembered that, because he had the jacket, he had withstood the cold of the dawn.
We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was grateful for the jacket’s weight and warmth.
The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was to travel, and, after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all the cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read. That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen. His parents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of pride for a simple farm family. They worked hard just to have food and water, like the sheep. He had studied Latin, Spanish, and theology. But ever since he had been a child, he had wanted to know the world, and this was much more important to him than knowing God and learning about man’s sins. One afternoon, on a visit to his family, he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he didn’t want to become a priest. That he wanted to travel.
“PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED through this village, son,” said his father. “They come in search of new things, but when they leave they are basically the same people they were when they arrived. They climb the mountain to see the castle, and they wind up thinking that the past was better than what we have now. They have blond hair, or dark skin, but basically they’re the same as the people who live right here.”
“But I’d like to see the castles in the towns where they live,” the boy explained.
“Those people, when they see our land, say that they would like to live here forever,” his father continued.
“Well, I’d like to see their land, and see how they live,” said his son.
“The people who come here have a lot of money to spend, so they can afford to travel,” his father said. “Amongst us, the only ones who travel are the shepherds.”
“Well, then I’ll be a shepherd!”
His father said no more. The next day, he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient Spanish gold coins.
“I found these one day in the fields. I wanted them to be a part of your inheritance. But use them to buy your flock. Take to the fields, and someday you’ll learn that our countryside is the best, and our women are the most beautiful.”
And he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his father’s gaze a desire to be able, himself, to travel the world—a desire that was still alive, despite his father’s having had to bury it, over dozens of years, under the burden of struggling for water to drink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every night of his life.
THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RED, AND SUDDENLY THE sun appeared. The boy thought back to that conversation with his father, and felt happy; he had already seen many castles and met many women (but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence). He owned a jacket, a book that he could trade for another, and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able every day to live out his dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he had had enough of the sea, he
would already have known other cities, other women, and other chances to be happy. I couldn’t have found God in the seminary, he thought, as he looked at the sunrise.
Whenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel. He had never been to that ruined church before, in spite of having traveled through those parts many times. The world was huge and inexhaustible; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a while, and he would discover other interesting things. The problem is that they don’t even realize that they’re walking a new road every day. They don’t see that the fields are new and the seasons change. All they think about is food and water.
Maybe we’re all that way, the boy mused. Even me—I haven’t thought of other women since I met the merchant’s daughter. Looking at the sun, he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before midday. There, he could exchange his book for a thicker one, fill his wine bottle, shave, and have a haircut; he had to prepare himself for his meeting with the girl, and he didn’t want to think about the possibility that some other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep, had arrived there before him and asked for her hand.
It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting, he thought, as he looked again at the position of the sun, and hurried his pace. He had suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa, there was an old woman who interpreted dreams.
THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK of her house; it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads. The room’s furnishings consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and two chairs.
The woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well. Then she took both of his hands in hers, and began quietly to pray.
It sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had experience on the road with Gypsies; they also traveled, but they had no flocks of sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others. It was also said that they had a pact with the devil, and that they kidnapped children and, taking them away to their mysterious camps, made them their slaves. As a child, the boy had always been frightened to death that he would be captured by Gypsies, and this childhood fear returned when the old woman took his hands in hers.
But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to reassure himself. He didn’t want his hand to begin trembling, showing the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our Father silently.
“Very interesting,” said the woman, never taking her eyes from the boy’s hands, and then she fell silent.
The boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and the woman sensed it. He quickly pulled his hands away.
“I didn’t come here to have you read my palm,” he said, already regretting having come. He thought for a moment that it would be better to pay her fee and leave without learning a thing, that he was giving too much importance to his recurrent dream.
“You came so that you could learn about your dreams,” said the old woman. “And dreams are the language of God. When he speaks in our language, I can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in the language of the soul, it is only you who can understand. But, whichever it is, I’m going to charge you for the consultation.”
Another trick, the boy thought. But he decided to take a chance. A shepherd always takes his chances with wolves and with drought, and that’s what makes a shepherd’s life exciting.
“I have had the same dream twice,” he said. “I dreamed that I was in a field with my sheep, when a child appeared and began to play with the animals. I don’t like people to do that, because the sheep are afraid of strangers. But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them. I don’t know why. I don’t know how animals know the age of human beings.”
“Tell me more about your dream,” said the woman. “I have to get back to my cooking, and, since you don’t have much money, I can’t give you a lot of time.”
“The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while,” continued the boy, a bit upset. “And suddenly, the child took me by both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids.”
He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were. But she said nothing.
“Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,”—he said the last three words slowly, so that the old woman would understand—“the child said to me, ‘If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.’ And, just as she was about to show me the exact location, I woke up. Both times.”
The woman was silent for some time. Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully.
“I’m not going to charge you anything now,” she said. “But I want one-tenth of the treasure, if you find it.”
The boy laughed—out of happiness. He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure!
“Well, interpret the dream,” he said.
“First, swear to me. Swear that you will give me one-tenth of your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you.”
The shepherd swore that he would. The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
“It’s a dream in the language of the world,” she said. “I can interpret it, but the interpretation is very difficult. That’s why I feel that I deserve a part of what you find.
“And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in Egypt. I have never heard of them, but, if it was a child who showed them to you, they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make you a rich man.”
The boy was surprised, and then irritated. He didn’t need to seek out the old woman for this! But then he remembered that he wasn’t going to have to pay anything.
“I didn’t need to waste my time just for this,” he said.
“I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It’s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them. And since I am not wise, I have had to learn other arts, such as the reading of palms.”
“Well, how am I going to get to Egypt?”
“I only interpret dreams. I don’t know how to turn them into reality. That’s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with.”
“And what if I never get to Egypt?”
“Then I don’t get paid. It wouldn’t be the first time.”
And the woman told the boy to leave, saying she had already wasted too much time with him.
So the boy was disappointed; he decided that he would never again believe in dreams. He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of: he went to the market for something
to eat, he traded his book for one that was thicker, and he found a bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had bought. The day was hot, and the wine was refreshing. The sheep were at the gates of the city, in a stable that belonged to a friend. The boy knew a lot of people in the city. That was what made traveling appeal to him—he always made new friends, and he didn’t need to spend all of his time with them. When someone sees the same people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary, they wind up becoming a part of that person’s life. And then they want the person to change. If someone isn’t what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.
He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields. Three days from now, he would be with the merchant’s daughter.
He started to read the book he had bought. On the very first page it described a burial ceremony. And the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book, he thought, he would present one person at a time, so that the reader wouldn’t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names.
When he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading, he liked the book better; the burial was on a snowy day, and he welcomed the feeling of being cold. As he read on, an old man sat down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation.
“What are they doing?” the old man asked, pointing at the people in the plaza.
“Working,” the boy answered dryly, making it look as if he wanted to concentrate on his reading.
Actually, he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the merchant’s daughter, so that she could see that he was someone who was capable of doing difficult things. He had already imagined the scene many times; every time, the girl became fascinated when he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front. He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep. Most of them he had read in books, but he would tell them as if they were from his personal experience. She would never know the difference, because she didn’t know how to read.
Meanwhile, the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation. He said that he was tired and thirsty, and asked if he might have a sip of the boy’s wine. The boy offered his bottle, hoping that the old man would leave him alone.
But the old man wanted to talk, and he asked the boy what book he was reading. The boy was tempted to be rude, and move to another bench, but his father had taught him to be respectful of the elderly. So he held out the book to the man—for two reasons: first, that he, himself, wasn’t sure how to pronounce the title; and second, that if the old man didn’t know how to read, he would probably feel ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches.
“Hmm…” said the old man, looking at all sides of the book, as if it were some strange object. “This is an important book, but it’s really irritating.”
The boy was shocked. The old man knew how to read, and had already read the book. And if the book was irritating, as the old man had said, the boy still had time to change it for another.
“It’s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in the world say,” continued the old man. “It describes people’s inability to choose their own Personal Legends. And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world’s greatest lie.”
“What’s the world’s greatest lie?” the boy asked, completely surprised.
“It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That’s the world’s greatest lie.”
“That’s never happened to me,” the boy said. “They wanted me to be a priest, but I decided to become a shepherd.”
“Much better,” said the old man. “Because you really like to travel.”
“He knew what I was thinking,” the boy said to himself. The old man, meanwhile, was leafing through the book, without seeming to want to return it at all. The boy noticed that the man’s clothing was strange. He looked like an Arab, which was not unusual in those parts. Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa; one had only to cross the narrow straits by boat. Arabs often appeared in the city, shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day.
“Where are you from?” the boy asked.
“From many places.”
“No one can be from many places,” the boy said. “I’m a shepherd, and I have been to many places, but I come from only one place—from a city near an ancient castle. That’s where I was born.”
“Well then, we could say that I was born in Salem.”
The boy didn’t know where Salem was, but he didn’t want to ask, fearing that he would appear ignorant. He looked at the people in the plaza for a while; they were coming and going, and all of them seemed to be very busy.
“So, what is Salem like?” he asked, trying to get some sort of clue.
“It’s like it always has been.”
No clue yet. But he knew that Salem wasn’t in Andalusia. If it were, he would already have heard of it.
“And what do you do in Salem?” he insisted.
“What do I do in Salem?” The old man laughed. “Well, I’m the king of Salem!”
People say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it’s better to be with the sheep, who don’t say anything. And better still to be alone with one’s books. They tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them. But when you’re talking to people, they say some things that are so strange that you don’t know how to continue the conversation.
“My name is Melchizedek,” said the old man. “How many sheep do you have?”
“Enough,” said the boy. He could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life.
“Well, then, we’ve got a problem. I can’t help you if you feel you’ve got enough sheep.”
The boy was getting irritated. He wasn’t asking for help. It was the old man who had asked for a drink of his wine, and had started the conversation.
“Give me my book,” the boy said. “I have to go and gather my sheep and get going.”
“Give me one-tenth of your sheep,” said the old man, “and I’ll tell you how to find the hidden treasure.”
The boy remembered his dream, and suddenly everything was clear to him. The old woman hadn’t charged him anything, but the old man—maybe he was her husband—was going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something that didn’t even exist. The old man was probably a Gypsy, too.
But before the boy could say anything, the old man leaned over, picked up a stick, and began to write in the sand of the plaza. Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that
the boy was momentarily blinded. With a movement that was too quick for someone his age, the man covered whatever it was with his cape. When his vision returned to normal, the boy was able to read what the old man had written in the sand.
There, in the sand of the plaza of that small city, the boy read the names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he had attended. He read the name of the merchant’s daughter, which he hadn’t even known, and he read things he had never told anyone.
“I’M THE KING OF SALEM,” THE OLD MAN HAD SAID.
“Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?” the boy asked, awed and embarrassed.
“For several reasons. But let’s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend.”
The boy didn’t know what a person’s “Personal Legend” was.
“It’s what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.
“At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.”
None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy. But he wanted to know what the “mysterious force” was; the merchant’s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that!
“It’s a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you how to realize your Personal Legend. It prepares your spirit and
your will, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your mission on earth.”
“Even when all you want to do is travel? Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant?”
“Yes, or even search for treasure. The Soul of the World is nourished by people’s happiness. And also by unhappiness, envy, and jealousy. To realize one’s Personal Legend is a person’s only real obligation. All things are one.
“And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”
They were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the townspeople. It was the old man who spoke first.
“Why do you tend a flock of sheep?”
“Because I like to travel.”
The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at one corner of the plaza. “When he was a child, that man wanted to travel, too. But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside. When he’s an old man, he’s going to spend a month in Africa. He never realized that people are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.”
“He should have decided to become a shepherd,” the boy said.
“Well, he thought about that,” the old man said. “But bakers are more important people than shepherds. Bakers have homes, while shepherds sleep out in the open. Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds.”
The boy felt a pang in his heart, thinking about the merchant’s daughter. There was surely a baker in her town.
The old man continued, “In the long run, what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends.”
The old man leafed through the book, and fell to reading a page he came to. The boy waited, and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted. “Why are you telling me all this?”
“Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend. And you are at the point where you’re about to give it all up.”
“And that’s when you always appear on the scene?”
“Not always in this way, but I always appear in one form or another. Sometimes I appear in the form of a solution, or a good idea. At other times, at a crucial moment, I make it easier for things to happen. There are other things I do, too, but most of the time people don’t realize I’ve done them.”
The old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to appear before a miner, and had taken the form of a stone. The miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years he had been working a certain river, and had examined hundreds of thousands of stones looking for an emerald. The miner was about to give it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one more stone—just one more—he would find his emerald. Since the miner had sacrificed everything to his Personal Legend, the old man decided to become involved. He transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner’s foot. The miner, with all the anger and frustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the stone and threw it aside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it fell upon, and there, embedded in the broken stone, was the most beautiful emerald in the world.
“People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,” said the old man, with a certain bitterness. “Maybe that’s why they give up on it so early, too. But that’s the way it is.”
The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure.
“Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is buried by the same currents,” said the old man. “If you want to learn about your own treasure, you will have to give me one-tenth of your flock.”
“What about one-tenth of my treasure?”
The old man looked disappointed. “If you start out by promising what you don’t even have yet, you’ll lose your desire to work toward getting it.”
The boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy.
“Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that,” sighed the old man. “In any case, it’s good that you’ve learned that everything in life has its price. This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach.”
The old man returned the book to the boy.
“Tomorrow, at this same time, bring me a tenth of your flock. And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure. Good afternoon.”
And he vanished around the corner of the plaza.
THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK, BUT HE WAS NO longer able to concentrate. He was tense and upset, because he knew that the old man was right. He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of bread, thinking about whether or not he should tell the baker what the old man had said about him. Sometimes it’s better to leave
things as they are, he thought to himself, and decided to say nothing. If he were to say anything, the baker would spend three days thinking about giving it all up, even though he had gotten used to the way things were. The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker. So he began to wander through the city, and found himself at the gates. There was a small building there, with a window at which people bought tickets to Africa. And he knew that Egypt was in Africa.
“Can I help you?” asked the man behind the window.
“Maybe tomorrow,” said the boy, moving away. If he sold just one of his sheep, he’d have enough to get to the other shore of the strait. The idea frightened him.
“Another dreamer,” said the ticket seller to his assistant, watching the boy walk away. “He doesn’t have enough money to travel.”
While standing at the ticket window, the boy had remembered his flock, and decided he should go back to being a shepherd. In two years he had learned everything about shepherding: he knew how to shear sheep, how to care for pregnant ewes, and how to protect the sheep from wolves. He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia. And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals.
He decided to return to his friend’s stable by the longest route possible. As he walked past the city’s castle, he interrupted his return, and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall. From there, he could see Africa in the distance. Someone had once told him that it was from there that the Moors had come, to occupy all of Spain.
He could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including the plaza where he had talked with the old man. Curse the moment I
met that old man, he thought. He had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream. Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd. They were solitary individuals who no longer believed in things, and didn’t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep. He knew everything about each member of his flock: he knew which ones were lame, which one was to give birth two months from now, and which were the laziest. He knew how to shear them, and how to slaughter them. If he ever decided to leave them, they would suffer.
The wind began to pick up. He knew that wind: people called it the levanter, because on it the Moors had come from the Levant at the eastern end of the Mediterranean.
The levanter increased in intensity. Here I am, between my flock and my treasure, the boy thought. He had to choose between something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted to have. There was also the merchant’s daughter, but she wasn’t as important as his flock, because she didn’t depend on him. Maybe she didn’t even remember him. He was sure that it made no difference to her on which day he appeared: for her, every day was the same, and when each day is the same as the next, it’s because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.
I left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. They have gotten used to my being away, and so have I. The sheep will get used to my not being there, too, the boy thought.
From where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued to come and go from the baker’s shop. A young couple sat on the bench where he had talked with the old man, and they kissed.
“That baker…” he said to himself, without completing the thought. The levanter was still getting stronger, and he felt its force on his face. That wind had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women. It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search for the unknown, and for gold and adventure—and for the Pyramids. The boy felt jealous of the freedom of the wind, and saw that he could have the same freedom. There was nothing to hold him back except himself. The sheep, the merchant’s daughter, and the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend.
The next day, the boy met the old man at noon. He brought six sheep with him.
“I’m surprised,” the boy said. “My friend bought all the other sheep immediately. He said that he had always dreamed of being a shepherd, and that it was a good omen.”
“That’s the way it always is,” said the old man. “It’s called the principle of favorability. When you play cards the first time, you are almost sure to win. Beginner’s luck.”
“Why is that?”
“Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend; it whets your appetite with a taste of success.”
Then the old man began to inspect the sheep, and he saw that one was lame. The boy explained that it wasn’t important, since that sheep was the most intelligent of the flock, and produced the most wool.
“Where is the treasure?” he asked.
“It’s in Egypt, near the Pyramids.”
The boy was startled. The old woman had said the same thing. But she hadn’t charged him anything.
“In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens. God has prepared a path for everyone to follow. You just have to read the omens that he left for you.”
Before the boy could reply, a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man. He remembered something his grandfather had once told him: that butterflies were a good omen. Like crickets, and like grasshoppers; like lizards and four-leaf clovers.
“That’s right,” said the old man, able to read the boy’s thoughts. “Just as your grandfather taught you. These are good omens.”
The old man opened his cape, and the boy was struck by what he saw. The old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold, covered with precious stones. The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day.
He really was a king! He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves.
“Take these,” said the old man, holding out a white stone and a black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate. “They are called Urim and Thummim. The black signifies ‘yes,’ and the white ‘no.’ When you are unable to read the omens, they will help you to do so. Always ask an objective question.
“But, if you can, try to make your own decisions. The treasure is at the Pyramids; that you already knew. But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision.”
The boy put the stones in his pouch. From then on, he would make his own decisions.
“Don’t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else. And don’t forget the language of omens. And, above all,
don’t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion.
“But before I go, I want to tell you a little story.
“A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world. The lad wandered through the desert for forty days, and finally came upon a beautiful castle, high atop a mountain. It was there that the wise man lived.
“Rather than finding a saintly man, though, our hero, on entering the main room of the castle, saw a hive of activity: tradesmen came and went, people were conversing in the corners, a small orchestra was playing soft music, and there was a table covered with platters of the most delicious food in that part of the world. The wise man conversed with everyone, and the boy had to wait for two hours before it was his turn to be given the man’s attention.
“The wise man listened attentively to the boy’s explanation of why he had come, but told him that he didn’t have time just then to explain the secret of happiness. He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours.
“‘Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do something,’ said the wise man, handing the boy a teaspoon that held two drops of oil. ‘As you wander around, carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil to spill.’
“The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of the palace, keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon. After two hours, he returned to the room where the wise man was.
“‘Well,’ asked the wise man, ‘did you see the Persian tapestries that are hanging in my dining hall? Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create? Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library?’
“The boy was embarrassed, and confessed that he had observed nothing. His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him.
“‘Then go back and observe the marvels of my world,’ said the wise man. ‘You cannot trust a man if you don’t know his house.’
“Relieved, the boy picked up the spoon and returned to his exploration of the palace, this time observing all of the works of art on the ceilings and the walls. He saw the gardens, the mountains all around him, the beauty of the flowers, and the taste with which everything had been selected. Upon returning to the wise man, he related in detail everything he had seen.
“‘But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you?’ asked the wise man.
“Looking down at the spoon he held, the boy saw that the oil was gone.
“‘Well, there is only one piece of advice I can give you,’ said the wisest of wise men. ‘The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.’”
The shepherd said nothing. He had understood the story the old king had told him. A shepherd may like to travel, but he should never forget about his sheep.
The old man looked at the boy and, with his hands held together, made several strange gestures over the boy’s head. Then, taking his sheep, he walked away.
AT THE HIGHEST POINT IN TARIFA THERE IS AN OLD FORT, built by the Moors. From atop its walls, one can catch a glimpse of Africa. Melchizedek, the king of Salem, sat on the wall of the fort that
afternoon, and felt the levanter blowing in his face. The sheep fidgeted nearby, uneasy with their new owner and excited by so much change. All they wanted was food and water.
Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port. He would never again see the boy, just as he had never seen Abraham again after having charged him his one-tenth fee. That was his work.
The gods should not have desires, because they don’t have Personal Legends. But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful.
It’s too bad that he’s quickly going to forget my name, he thought. I should have repeated it for him. Then when he spoke about me he would say that I am Melchizedek, the king of Salem.
He looked to the skies, feeling a bit abashed, and said, “I know it’s the vanity of vanities, as you said, my Lord. But an old king sometimes has to take some pride in himself.”
HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS, THOUGHT THE BOY.
He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier. Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other. In just a few hours he had seen men walking hand in hand, women with their faces covered, and priests that climbed to the tops of towers and chanted—as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground.
“A practice of infidels,” he said to himself. As a child in church, he had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his white horse, his sword unsheathed, and figures such as these
kneeling at his feet. The boy felt ill and terribly alone. The infidels had an evil look about them.
Besides this, in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail, just one detail, which could keep him from his treasure for a long time: only Arabic was spoken in this country.
The owner of the bar approached him, and the boy pointed to a drink that had been served at the next table. It turned out to be a bitter tea. The boy preferred wine.
But he didn’t need to worry about that right now. What he had to be concerned about was his treasure, and how he was going to go about getting it. The sale of his sheep had left him with enough money in his pouch, and the boy knew that in money there was magic; whoever has money is never really alone. Before long, maybe in just a few days, he would be at the Pyramids. An old man, with a breastplate of gold, wouldn’t have lied just to acquire six sheep.
The old man had spoken about signs and omens, and, as the boy was crossing the strait, he had thought about omens. Yes, the old man had known what he was talking about: during the time the boy had spent in the fields of Andalusia, he had become used to learning which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky. He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a snake was nearby, and that a certain shrub was a sign that there was water in the area. The sheep had taught him that.
If God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he thought, and that made him feel better. The tea seemed less bitter.
“Who are you?” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish.
The boy was relieved. He was thinking about omens, and someone had appeared.
“How come you speak Spanish?” he asked. The new arrival was a young man in Western dress, but the color of his skin suggested he was from this city. He was about the same age and height as the boy.
“Almost everyone here speaks Spanish. We’re only two hours from Spain.”
“Sit down, and let me treat you to something,” said the boy. “And ask for a glass of wine for me. I hate this tea.”
“There is no wine in this country,” the young man said. “The religion here forbids it.”
The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids. He almost began to tell about his treasure, but decided not to do so. If he did, it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as payment for taking him there. He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn’t even have yet.
“I’d like you to take me there if you can. I can pay you to serve as my guide.”
“Do you have any idea how to get there?” the newcomer asked.
The boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby, listening attentively to their conversation. He felt uneasy at the man’s presence. But he had found a guide, and didn’t want to miss out on an opportunity.
“You have to cross the entire Sahara desert,” said the young man. “And to do that, you need money. I need to know whether you have enough.”
The boy thought it a strange question. But he trusted in the old man, who had said that, when you really want something, the universe always conspires in your favor.
He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man. The owner of the bar came over and looked, as well. The two
men exchanged some words in Arabic, and the bar owner seemed irritated.
“Let’s get out of here,” said the new arrival. “He wants us to leave.”
The boy was relieved. He got up to pay the bill, but the owner grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of words. The boy was strong, and wanted to retaliate, but he was in a foreign country. His new friend pushed the owner aside, and pulled the boy outside with him. “He wanted your money,” he said. “Tangier is not like the rest of Africa. This is a port, and every port has its thieves.”
The boy trusted his new friend. He had helped him out in a dangerous situation. He took out his money and counted it.
“We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow,” said the other, taking the money. “But I have to buy two camels.”
They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier. Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale. They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held. There were thousands of people there, arguing, selling, and buying; vegetables for sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed alongside tobacco. But the boy never took his eye off his new friend. After all, he had all his money. He thought about asking him to give it back, but decided that would be unfriendly. He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in.
“I’ll just watch him,” he said to himself. He knew he was stronger than his friend.
Suddenly, there in the midst of all that confusion, he saw the most beautiful sword he had ever seen. The scabbard was embossed in silver, and the handle was black and encrusted with precious
stones. The boy promised himself that, when he returned from Egypt, he would buy that sword.
“Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs,” he said to his friend. Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments, looking at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest had suddenly compressed it. He was afraid to look around, because he knew what he would find. He continued to look at the beautiful sword for a bit longer, until he summoned the courage to turn around.
All around him was the market, with people coming and going, shouting and buying, and the aroma of strange foods…but nowhere could he find his new companion.
The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident. He decided to stay right there and await his return. As he waited, a priest climbed to the top of a nearby tower and began his chant; everyone in the market fell to their knees, touched their foreheads to the ground, and took up the chant. Then, like a colony of worker ants, they dismantled their stalls and left.
The sun began its departure, as well. The boy watched it through its trajectory for some time, until it was hidden behind the white houses surrounding the plaza. He recalled that when the sun had risen that morning, he was on another continent, still a shepherd with sixty sheep, and looking forward to meeting with a girl. That morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him as he walked through the familiar fields. But now, as the sun began to set, he was in a different country, a stranger in a strange land, where he couldn’t even speak the language. He was no longer a shepherd, and he had nothing, not even the money to return and start everything over.
All this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought. He was feeling sorry for himself, and lamenting the fact that his life could have changed so suddenly and so drastically.
He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry. He had never even wept in front of his own sheep. But the marketplace was empty, and he was far from home, so he wept. He wept because God was unfair, and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams.
When I had my sheep, I was happy, and I made those around me happy. People saw me coming and welcomed me, he thought. But now I’m sad and alone. I’m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me. I’m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine. And I’m going to hold on to what little I have, because I’m too insignificant to conquer the world.
He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions; maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship. But all he found was the heavy book, his jacket, and the two stones the old man had given him.
As he looked at the stones, he felt relieved for some reason. He had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate. He could sell the stones and buy a return ticket. But this time I’ll be smarter, the boy thought, removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket. This was a port town, and the only truthful thing his friend had told him was that port towns are full of thieves.
Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset: he was trying to tell him not to trust that man. “I’m like everyone else—I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.”
He ran his fingers slowly over the stones, sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces. They were his treasure. Just handling them made him feel better. They reminded him of the old man.
“When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it,” he had said.
The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said. There he was in the empty marketplace, without a cent to his name, and with not a sheep to guard through the night. But the stones were proof that he had met with a king—a king who knew of the boy’s past.
“They’re called Urim and Thummim, and they can help you to read the omens.” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment. The old man had said to ask very clear questions, and to do that, the boy had to know what he wanted. So, he asked if the old man’s blessing was still with him.
He took out one of the stones. It was “yes.”
“Am I going to find my treasure?” he asked.
He stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the stones. As he did so, both of them pushed through a hole in the pouch and fell to the ground. The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch. He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch. But as he saw them lying there on the ground, another phrase came to his mind.
“Learn to recognize omens, and follow them,” the old king had said.
An omen. The boy smiled to himself. He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch. He didn’t consider mending the hole—the stones could fall through any time they wanted. He had learned that there were certain things one shouldn’t ask about,
so as not to flee from one’s own Personal Legend. “I promised that I would make my own decisions,” he said to himself.
But the stones had told him that the old man was still with him, and that made him feel more confident. He looked around at the empty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn’t a strange place; it was a new one.
After all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new places. Even if he never got to the Pyramids, he had already traveled farther than any shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how different things are just two hours by ship from where they are, he thought. Although his new world at the moment was just an empty marketplace, he had already seen it when it was teeming with life, and he would never forget it. He remembered the sword. It hurt him a bit to think about it, but he had never seen one like it before. As he mused about these things, he realized that he had to choose between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure.
“I’m an adventurer, looking for treasure,” he said to himself.
HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE. HE had fallen asleep in the middle of the marketplace, and life in the plaza was about to resume.
Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he was in a new world. But instead of being saddened, he was happy. He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep; he could go in search of his treasure, instead. He had not a cent in his pocket, but he had faith. He had decided, the night before, that he would be as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books.
He walked slowly through the market. The merchants were assembling their stalls, and the boy helped a candy seller to do his. The candy seller had a smile on his face: he was happy, aware of what his life was about, and ready to begin a day’s work. His smile reminded the boy of the old man—the mysterious old king he had met. “This candy merchant isn’t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper’s daughter. He’s doing it because it’s what he wants to do,” thought the boy. He realized that he could do the same thing the old man had done—sense whether a person was near to or far from his Personal Legend. Just by looking at them. It’s easy, and yet I’ve never done it before, he thought.
When the stall was assembled, the candy seller offered the boy the first sweet he had made for the day. The boy thanked him, ate it, and went on his way. When he had gone only a short distance, he realized that, while they were erecting the stall, one of them had spoken Arabic and the other Spanish.
And they had understood each other perfectly well.
There must be a language that doesn’t depend on words, the boy thought. I’ve already had that experience with my sheep, and now it’s happening with people.
He was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things that he had already experienced, and weren’t really new, but that he had never perceived before. And he hadn’t perceived them because he had become accustomed to them. He realized: If I can learn to understand this language without words, I can learn to understand the world.
Relaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of Tangier. Only in that way would he be able to read the omens. He knew it would require a lot of patience, but shepherds know all about patience. Once again he saw that, in that
strange land, he was applying the same lessons he had learned with his sheep.
“All things are one,” the old man had said.
THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT AWOKE WITH THE DAY, AND FELT the same anxiety that he felt every morning. He had been in the same place for thirty years: a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed. Now it was too late to change anything—the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware. There had been a time when many people knew of his shop: Arab merchants, French and English geologists, German soldiers who were always well-heeled. In those days it had been wonderful to be selling crystal, and he had thought how he would become rich, and have beautiful women at his side as he grew older.
But, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of Ceuta had grown faster than Tangier, and business had fallen off. Neighbors moved away, and there remained only a few small shops on the hill. And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops.
But the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years of his life buying and selling crystal pieces, and now it was too late to do anything else.
He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street. He had done this for years, and knew the schedule of everyone who passed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy stopped in front of the shop. He was dressed normally, but the practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no
money to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant decided to delay his lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on.
A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT several languages were spoken in the shop. The boy saw a man appear behind the counter.
“I can clean up those glasses in the window, if you want,” said the boy. “The way they look now, nobody is going to want to buy them.”
The man looked at him without responding.
“In exchange, you could give me something to eat.”
The man still said nothing, and the boy sensed that he was going to have to make a decision. In his pouch, he had his jacket—he certainly wasn’t going to need it in the desert. Taking the jacket out, he began to clean the glasses. In half an hour, he had cleaned all the glasses in the window, and, as he was doing so, two customers had entered the shop and bought some crystal.
When he had completed the cleaning, he asked the man for something to eat. “Let’s go and have some lunch,” said the crystal merchant.
He put a sign on the door, and they went to a small café nearby. As they sat down at the only table in the place, the crystal merchant laughed.
“You didn’t have to do any cleaning,” he said. “The Koran requires me to feed a hungry person.”
“Well then, why did you let me do it?” the boy asked.
“Because the crystal was dirty. And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts.”
When they had eaten, the merchant turned to the boy and said, “I’d like you to work in my shop. Two customers came in today while you were working, and that’s a good omen.”
People talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they really don’t know what they’re saying. Just as I hadn’t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep.
“Do you want to go to work for me?” the merchant asked.
“I can work for the rest of today,” the boy answered. “I’ll work all night, until dawn, and I’ll clean every piece of crystal in your shop. In return, I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow.”
The merchant laughed. “Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year…even if you earned a good commission selling every piece, you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt. There are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there.”
There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep. No sound from the bazaars, no arguments among the merchants, no men climbing to the towers to chant. No hope, no adventure, no old kings or Personal Legends, no treasure, and no Pyramids. It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy’s soul had. He sat there, staring blankly through the door of the café, wishing that he had died, and that everything would end forever at that moment.
The merchant looked anxiously at the boy. All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared.
“I can give you the money you need to get back to your country, my son,” said the crystal merchant.
The boy said nothing. He got up, adjusted his clothing, and picked up his pouch.
“I’ll work for you,” he said.
And after another long silence, he added, “I need money to buy some sheep.”
PART TWO
THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT for almost a month, and he could see that it wasn’t exactly the kind of job that would make him happy. The merchant spent the entire day mumbling behind the counter, telling the boy to be careful with the pieces and not to break anything.
But he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he was an old grouch, treated him fairly; the boy received a good commission for each piece he sold, and had already been able to put some money aside. That morning he had done some calculating: if he continued to work every day as he had been, he would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep.
“I’d like to build a display case for the crystal,” the boy said to the merchant. “We could place it outside, and attract those people who pass at the bottom of the hill.”
“I’ve never had one before,” the merchant answered. “People will pass by and bump into it, and pieces will be broken.”
“Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them might have died if we had come upon a snake. But that’s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds.”
The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses. He was selling better than ever…as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier’s major attractions.
“Business has really improved,” he said to the boy, after the customer had left. “I’m doing much better, and soon you’ll be able to return to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?”
“Because we have to respond to omens,” the boy said, almost without meaning to; then he regretted what he had said, because the merchant had never met the king.
“It’s called the principle of favorability, beginner’s luck. Because life wants you to achieve your Personal Legend,” the old king had said.
But the merchant understood what the boy had said. The boy’s very presence in the shop was an omen, and, as time passed and money was pouring into the cash drawer, he had no regrets about having hired the boy. The boy was being paid more money than he deserved, because the merchant, thinking that sales wouldn’t amount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate. He had assumed he would soon return to his sheep.
“Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?” he asked, to get away from the business of the display.
“Because I’ve always heard about them,” the boy answered, saying nothing about his dream. The treasure was now nothing but a painful memory, and he tried to avoid thinking about it.
“I don’t know anyone around here who would want to cross the desert just to see the Pyramids,” said the merchant. “They’re just a pile of stones. You could build one in your backyard.”
“You’ve never had dreams of travel,” said the boy, turning to wait on a customer who had entered the shop.
Two days later, the merchant spoke to the boy about the display.
“I don’t much like change,” he said. “You and I aren’t like Hassan, that rich merchant. If he makes a buying mistake, it doesn’t affect him much. But we two have to live with our mistakes.”
That’s true enough, the boy thought, ruefully.
“Why did you think we should have the display?”
“I want to get back to my sheep faster. We have to take advantage when luck is on our side, and do as much to help it as it’s doing to help us. It’s called the principle of favorability. Or beginner’s luck.”
The merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, “The Prophet gave us the Koran, and left us just five obligations to satisfy during our lives. The most important is to believe only in the one true God. The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan, and be charitable to the poor.”
He stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the Prophet. He was a devout man, and, even with all his impatience, he wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law.
“What’s the fifth obligation?” the boy asked.
“Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel,” the merchant answered. “The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a pilgrimage. We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy city of Mecca.
“Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was young, all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start this shop. I thought that someday I’d be rich, and could go to Mecca. I began to make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the shop; the crystals are delicate things. At the same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading for Mecca. Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans with servants and camels, but most of the people making the pilgrimage were poorer than I.
“All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses. One of them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had traveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more
tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather.”
“Well, why don’t you go to Mecca now?” asked the boy.
“Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That’s what helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible café. I’m afraid that if my dream is realized, I’ll have no reason to go on living.
“You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you’re different from me, because you want to realize your dreams. I just want to dream about Mecca. I’ve already imagined a thousand times crossing the desert, arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone, the seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it. I’ve already imagined the people who would be at my side, and those in front of me, and the conversations and prayers we would share. But I’m afraid that it would all be a disappointment, so I prefer just to dream about it.”
That day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display. Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way.
TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED, AND THE SHELF BROUGHT many customers into the crystal shop. The boy estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet another sixty. In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock, and he would be able to do business with the Arabs, because he was now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in the marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim and Thummim,
because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, the boy had become happy in his work, and thought all the time about the day when he would disembark at Tarifa as a winner.
“You must always know what it is that you want,” the old king had said. The boy knew, and was now working toward it. Maybe it was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a thief, and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.
He was proud of himself. He had learned some important things, like how to deal in crystal, and about the language without words…and about omens. One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of the hill, complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to get something to drink after such a climb. The boy, accustomed to recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.
“Let’s sell tea to the people who climb the hill.”
“Lots of places sell tea around here,” the merchant said.
“But we could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses. I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men.”
The merchant didn’t respond, but that afternoon, after saying his prayers and closing the shop, he invited the boy to sit with him and share his hookah, that strange pipe used by the Arabs.
“What is it you’re looking for?” asked the old merchant.
“I’ve already told you. I need to buy my sheep back, so I have to earn the money to do so.”
The merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled deeply.
“I’ve had this shop for thirty years. I know good crystal from bad, and everything else there is to know about crystal. I know its
dimensions and how it behaves. If we serve tea in crystal, the shop is going to expand. And then I’ll have to change my way of life.”
“Well, isn’t that good?”
“I’m already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was thinking about how much time I had wasted in the same place, while my friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better than they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I can see that it hasn’t been too bad. The shop is exactly the size I always wanted it to be. I don’t want to change anything, because I don’t know how to deal with change. I’m used to the way I am.”
The boy didn’t know what to say. The old man continued, “You have been a real blessing to me. Today, I understand something I didn’t see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don’t want anything else in life. But you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I’m going to feel worse than I did before you arrived. Because I know the things I should be able to accomplish, and I don’t want to do so.”
It’s good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa, thought the boy to himself.
They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set. They were conversing in Arabic, and the boy was proud of himself for being able to do so. There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world. But they could never have taught him Arabic.
There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can’t teach me, thought the boy as he regarded the old merchant. All they ever do, really, is look for food and water. And maybe it wasn’t that they were teaching me, but that I was learning from them.
“Maktub,” the merchant said, finally.
“What does that mean?”
“You would have to have been born an Arab to understand,” he answered. “But in your language it would be something like ‘It is written.’”
And, as he smothered the coals in the hookah, he told the boy that he could begin to sell tea in the crystal glasses. Sometimes, there’s just no way to hold back the river.
THE MEN CLIMBED THE HILL, AND THEY WERE TIRED when they reached the top. But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea. They went in to drink the tea, which was served in beautiful crystal glasses.
“My wife never thought of this,” said one, and he bought some crystal—he was entertaining guests that night, and the guests would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware. The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in crystal, because the aroma was retained. The third said that it was a tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers.
Before long, the news spread, and a great many people began to climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old. Other shops were opened that served tea in crystal, but they weren’t at the top of a hill, and they had little business.
Eventually, the merchant had to hire two more employees. He began to import enormous quantities of tea, along with his crystal, and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new.
And, in that way, the months passed.
THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN. IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent.
He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought especially for this day. He put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin. Wearing his new sandals, he descended the stairs silently.
The city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass. Then he sat in the sun-filled doorway, smoking the hookah.
He smoked in silence, thinking of nothing, and listening to the sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert. When he had finished his smoke, he reached into one of his pockets, and sat there for a few moments, regarding what he had withdrawn.
It was a bundle of money. Enough to buy himself a hundred and twenty sheep, a return ticket, and a license to import products from Africa into his own country.
He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop. Then the two went off to have some more tea.
“I’m leaving today,” said the boy. “I have the money I need to buy my sheep. And you have the money you need to go to Mecca.”
The old man said nothing.
“Will you give me your blessing?” asked the boy. “You have helped me.” The man continued to prepare his tea, saying nothing. Then he turned to the boy.
“I am proud of you,” he said. “You brought a new feeling into my crystal shop. But you know that I’m not going to go to Mecca. Just as you know that you’re not going to buy your sheep.”
“Who told you that?” asked the boy, startled.
“Maktub,” said the old crystal merchant.
And he gave the boy his blessing.
THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS. They filled three sacks. As he was leaving, he saw, in the corner of the room, his old shepherd’s pouch. It was bunched up, and he had hardly thought of it for a long time. As he took his jacket out of the pouch, thinking to give it to someone in the street, the two stones fell to the floor. Urim and Thummim.
It made the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize how long it had been since he had thought of him. For nearly a year, he had been working incessantly, thinking only of putting aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride.
“Never stop dreaming,” the old king had said. “Follow the omens.”
The boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the strange sensation that the old king was nearby. He had worked hard for a year, and the omens were that it was time to go.
I’m going to go back to doing just what I did before, the boy thought. Even though the sheep didn’t teach me to speak Arabic.
But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of
things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange city, and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world.
“When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it,” the old king had said.
But the old king hadn’t said anything about being robbed, or about endless deserts, or about people who know what their dreams are but don’t want to realize them. The old king hadn’t told him that the Pyramids were just a pile of stones, or that anyone could build one in his backyard. And he had forgotten to mention that, when you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before, you should buy it.
The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign couple, while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking tea from crystal glasses. It was more activity than usual for this time of the morning. From where he stood, he saw for the first time that the old merchant’s hair was very much like the hair of the old king. He remembered the smile of the candy seller, on his first day in Tangier, when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to go—that smile had also been like the old king’s smile.
It’s almost as if he had been here and left his mark, he thought. And yet, none of these people has ever met the old king. On the other hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are trying to realize their Personal Legend.
He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant. He didn’t want to cry with the other people there. He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned. He was more
confident in himself, though, and felt as though he could conquer the world.
“But I’m going back to the fields that I know, to take care of my flock again.” He said that to himself with certainty, but he was no longer happy with his decision. He had worked for an entire year to make a dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was becoming less important. Maybe because that wasn’t really his dream.
Who knows…maybe it’s better to be like the crystal merchant: never go to Mecca, and just go through life wanting to do so, he thought, again trying to convince himself. But as he held Urim and Thummim in his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and will of the old king. By coincidence—or maybe it was an omen, the boy thought—he came to the bar he had entered on his first day there. The thief wasn’t there, and the owner brought him a cup of tea.
I can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought. I learned how to care for sheep, and I haven’t forgotten how that’s done. But maybe I’ll never have another chance to get to the Pyramids in Egypt. The old man wore a breastplate of gold, and he knew about my past. He really was a king, a wise king.
The hills of Andalusia were only two hours away, but there was an entire desert between him and the Pyramids. Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation: he was actually two hours closer to his treasure…the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn’t matter.
I know why I want to get back to my flock, he thought. I understand sheep; they’re no longer a problem, and they can be good friends. On the other hand, I don’t know if the desert can be a friend, and it’s in the desert that I have to search for my treasure. If I
don’t find it, I can always go home. I finally have enough money, and all the time I need. Why not?
He suddenly felt tremendously happy. He could always go back to being a shepherd. He could always become a crystal salesman again. Maybe the world had other hidden treasures, but he had a dream, and he had met with a king. That doesn’t happen to just anyone!
He was planning as he left the bar. He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant’s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert. He held Urim and Thummim in his hand; because of those two stones, he was once again on the way to his treasure.
“I am always nearby, when someone wants to realize their Personal Legend,” the old king had told him.
What could it cost to go over to the supplier’s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away?
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE that smelled of animals, sweat, and dust; it was part warehouse, part corral. I never thought I’d end up in a place like this, he thought, as he leafed through the pages of a chemical journal. Ten years at the university, and here I am in a corral.
But he had to move on. He believed in omens. All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the universe. First he had studied Esperanto, then the world’s religions, and now it was alchemy. He knew how to speak Esperanto, he understood all the major religions well, but he wasn’t yet an alchemist. He had unraveled the truths behind important questions,
but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go. He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist. But the alchemists were strange people, who thought only about themselves, and almost always refused to help him. Who knows, maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master Work—the Philosopher’s Stone—and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves.
He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father, fruitlessly seeking the Philosopher’s Stone. He had spent enormous amounts of time at the great libraries of the world, and had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy. In one he had read that, many years ago, a famous Arabian alchemist had visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two hundred years old, and that he had discovered the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story. But he would never have thought it more than just a myth, had not a friend of his—returning from an archaeological expedition in the desert—told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers.
“He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,” his friend had said. “And people say that he is two hundred years old, and is able to transform any metal into gold.”
The Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his books, and now here he was, sitting inside a dusty, smelly warehouse. Outside, a huge caravan was being prepared for a crossing of the Sahara, and was scheduled to pass through Al-Fayoum.
I’m going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman thought. And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable.
A young Arab, also loaded down with baggage, entered, and greeted the Englishman.
“Where are you bound?” asked the young Arab.
“I’m going into the desert,” the man answered, turning back to his reading. He didn’t want any conversation at this point. What he needed to do was review all he had learned over the years, because the alchemist would certainly put him to the test.
The young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book was written in Spanish. That’s good, thought the Englishman. He spoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if this boy was going to Al-Fayoum, there would be someone to talk to when there were no other important things to do.
“THAT’S STRANGE,” SAID THE BOY, AS HE TRIED ONCE again to read the burial scene that began the book. “I’ve been trying for two years to read this book, and I never get past these first few pages.” Even without a king to provide an interruption, he was unable to concentrate.
He still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he was able to understand one thing: making a decision was only the beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.
When I decided to seek out my treasure, I never imagined that I’d wind up working in a crystal shop, he thought. And joining this caravan may have been my decision, but where it goes is going to be a mystery to me.
Nearby was the Englishman, reading a book. He seemed unfriendly, and had looked irritated when the boy had entered. They might even have become friends, but the Englishman closed off the conversation.
The boy closed his book. He felt that he didn’t want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman. He took Urim and Thummim from his pocket, and began playing with them.
The stranger shouted, “Urim and Thummim!”
In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket.
“They’re not for sale,” he said.
“They’re not worth much,” the Englishman answered. “They’re only made of rock crystal, and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth. But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim. I didn’t know that they had them in this part of the world.”
“They were given to me as a present by a king,” the boy said.
The stranger didn’t answer; instead, he put his hand in his pocket, and took out two stones that were the same as the boy’s.
“Did you say a king?” he asked.
“I guess you don’t believe that a king would talk to someone like me, a shepherd,” he said, wanting to end the conversation.
“Not at all. It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a king that the rest of the world refused to acknowledge. So, it’s not surprising that kings would talk to shepherds.”
And he went on, fearing that the boy wouldn’t understand what he was talking about, “It’s in the Bible. The same book that taught me about Urim and Thummim. These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God. The priests carried them in a golden breastplate.”
The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse.
“Maybe this is an omen,” said the Englishman, half aloud.
“Who told you about omens?” The boy’s interest was increasing by the moment.
“Everything in life is an omen,” said the Englishman, now closing the journal he was reading. “There is a universal language, understood by everybody, but already forgotten. I am in search of that universal language, among other things. That’s why I’m here. I have to find a man who knows that universal language. An alchemist.”
The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss.
“You’re in luck, you two,” the fat Arab said. “There’s a caravan leaving today for Al-Fayoum.”
“But I’m going to Egypt,” the boy said.
“Al-Fayoum is in Egypt,” said the Arab. “What kind of Arab are you?”
“That’s a good luck omen,” the Englishman said, after the fat Arab had gone out. “If I could, I’d write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence. It’s with those words that the universal language is written.”
He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with Urim and Thummim in his hand. And he asked the boy if he, too, were in search of the alchemist.
“I’m looking for a treasure,” said the boy, and he immediately regretted having said it. But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it.
“In a way, so am I,” he said.
“I don’t even know what alchemy is,” the boy was saying, when the warehouse boss called to them to come outside.
“I’M THE LEADER OF THE CARAVAN,” SAID A DARK-EYED, bearded man. “I hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me. The desert is a capricious lady, and sometimes she drives men crazy.”
There were almost two hundred people gathered there, and four hundred animals—camels, horses, mules, and fowl. In the crowd were women, children, and a number of men with swords at their belts and rifles slung on their shoulders. The Englishman had several suitcases filled with books. There was a babble of noise, and the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying.
“There are a lot of different people here, and each has his own God. But the only God I serve is Allah, and in his name I swear that I will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert. But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what. In the desert, disobedience means death.”
There was a murmur from the crowd. Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God. The boy swore to Jesus Christ. The Englishman said nothing. And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have. The people were also praying to heaven for protection.
A long note was sounded on a bugle, and everyone mounted up. The boy and the Englishman had bought camels, and climbed uncertainly onto their backs. The boy felt sorry for the Englishman’s camel, loaded down as he was with the cases of books.
“There’s no such thing as coincidence,” said the Englishman, picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the
warehouse. “I’m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who…”
But the caravan began to move, and it was impossible to hear what the Englishman was saying. The boy knew what he was about to describe, though: the mysterious chain that links one thing to another, the same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd, that had caused his recurring dream, that had brought him to a city near Africa, to find a king, and to be robbed in order to meet a crystal merchant, and…
The closer one gets to realizing his Personal Legend, the more that Personal Legend becomes his true reason for being, thought the boy.
The caravan moved toward the east. It traveled during the morning, halted when the sun was at its strongest, and resumed late in the afternoon. The boy spoke very little with the Englishman, who spent most of his time with his books.
The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert. Now everything was quite different from how it was that day they had set out: then, there had been confusion and shouting, the cries of children and the whinnying of animals, all mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants.
But, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind, and of the hoofbeats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very little to one another.
“I’ve crossed these sands many times,” said one of the camel drivers one night. “But the desert is so huge, and the horizons so distant, that they make a person feel small, and as if he should remain silent.”
The boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever having set foot in the desert before. Whenever he saw the sea, or a fire, he fell silent, impressed by their elemental force.
I’ve learned things from the sheep, and I’ve learned things from crystal, he thought. I can learn something from the desert, too. It seems old and wise.
The wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face. It reminded him of the wool from his sheep…his sheep who were now seeking food and water in the fields of Andalusia, as they always had.
“They’re not my sheep anymore,” he said to himself, without nostalgia. “They must be used to their new shepherd, and have probably already forgotten me. That’s good. Creatures like the sheep, that are used to traveling, know about moving on.”
He thought of the merchant’s daughter, and was sure that she had probably married. Perhaps to a baker, or to another shepherd who could read and could tell her exciting stories—after all, he probably wasn’t the only one. But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver’s comment: maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the present of all people. “Hunches,” his mother used to call them. The boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and we are able to know everything, because it’s all written there.
“Maktub,” the boy said, remembering the crystal merchant.
The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others. When the caravan was blocked by a boulder, it had to go around it; if there was a large rocky area, they had to make a major detour. If
the sand was too fine for the animals’ hooves, they sought a way where the sand was more substantial. In some places, the ground was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes. The animals balked at such places, and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden their charges. The drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels. If a guide were to fall ill or die, the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one.
But all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many detours and adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the same compass point. Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to its course, sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis. When the people saw that star shining in the morning sky, they knew they were on the right course toward water, palm trees, shelter, and other people. It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all this; he was, for the most part, immersed in reading his books.
The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the first few days of the journey. But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had learned to know his camel better, and to establish a relationship with him, he threw the book away. Although the boy had developed a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn something important, he decided it was an unnecessary burden.
He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him. At night, as they sat around the fire, the boy related to the driver his adventures as a shepherd.
During one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life.
“I used to live near El Cairum,” he said. “I had my orchard, my children, and a life that would change not at all until I died. One
year, when the crop was the best ever, we all went to Mecca, and I satisfied the only unmet obligation in my life. I could die happily, and that made me feel good.
“One day, the earth began to tremble, and the Nile overflowed its banks. It was something that I thought could happen only to others, never to me. My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive trees in the flood, and my wife was afraid that we would lose our children. I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed.
“The land was ruined, and I had to find some other way to earn a living. So now I’m a camel driver. But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah: people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.
“We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it’s our life or our possessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand.”
Sometimes, their caravan met with another. One always had something that the other needed—as if everything were indeed written by one hand. As they sat around the fire, the camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms, and told stories about the desert.
At other times, mysterious, hooded men would appear; they were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route. They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes. They came in silence and departed the same way, dressed in black garments that showed only their eyes. One night, a camel driver came to the fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting. “There are rumors of tribal wars,” he told them.
The three fell silent. The boy noted that there was a sense of fear in the air, even though no one said anything. Once again he was experiencing the language without words…the universal language.
The Englishman asked if they were in danger.
“Once you get into the desert, there’s no going back,” said the camel driver. “And, when you can’t go back, you have to worry only about the best way of moving forward. The rest is up to Allah, including the danger.”
And he concluded by saying the mysterious word: “Maktub.”
“You should pay more attention to the caravan,” the boy said to the Englishman, after the camel driver had left. “We make a lot of detours, but we’re always heading for the same destination.”
“And you ought to read more about the world,” answered the Englishman. “Books are like caravans in that respect.”
The immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster. The days had always been silent, but now, even the nights—when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires—had also become quiet. And, one day, the leader of the caravan made the decision that the fires should no longer be lighted, so as not to attract attention to the caravan.
The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a circle at night, sleeping together in the center as protection against the nocturnal cold. And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group.
The Englishman was unable to sleep one night. He called to the boy, and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment. There was a full moon, and the boy told the Englishman the story of his life.
The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there.
“That’s the principle that governs all things,” he said. “In alchemy, it’s called the Soul of the World. When you want something with all your heart, that’s when you are closest to the Soul of the World. It’s always a positive force.”
He also said that this was not just a human gift, that everything on the face of the earth had a soul, whether mineral, vegetable, or animal—or even just a simple thought.
“Everything on earth is being continuously transformed, because the earth is alive…and it has a soul. We are part of that soul, so we rarely recognize that it is working for us. But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success.”
The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands. “I have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert,” he said. “The caravan and the desert speak the same language, and it’s for that reason that the desert allows the crossing. It’s going to test the caravan’s every step to see if it’s in time, and, if it is, we will make it to the oasis.”
“If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal courage, but without understanding that language, this journey would have been much more difficult.”
They stood there looking at the moon.
“That’s the magic of omens,” said the boy. “I’ve seen how the guides read the signs of the desert, and how the soul of the caravan speaks to the soul of the desert.”
The Englishman said, “I’d better pay more attention to the caravan.”
“And I’d better read your books,” said the boy.
THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS. THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY, salt, dragons, and kings, and he didn’t understand any of it. But there was one idea that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books: all things are the manifestation of one thing only.
In one of the books he learned that the most important text in the literature of alchemy contained only a few lines, and had been inscribed on the surface of an emerald.
“It’s the Emerald Tablet,” said the Englishman, proud that he might teach something to the boy.
“Well, then, why do we need all these books?” the boy asked.
“So that we can understand those few lines,” the Englishman answered, without appearing really to believe what he had said.
The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists. They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories; they believed that, if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and what was left would be the Soul of the World. This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything on the face of the earth, because it was the language with which all things communicated. They called that discovery the Master Work—it was part liquid and part solid.
“Can’t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language?” the boy asked.
“You have a mania for simplifying everything,” answered the Englishman, irritated. “Alchemy is a serious discipline. Every step has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters.”
The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was called the Elixir of Life, and that it cured all illnesses; it also kept the
alchemist from growing old. And the solid part was called the Philosopher’s Stone.
“It’s not easy to find the Philosopher’s Stone,” said the Englishman. “The alchemists spent years in their laboratories, observing the fire that purified the metals. They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world. They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves.”
The boy thought about the crystal merchant. He had said that it was a good thing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces, so that he could free himself from negative thoughts. The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one’s daily life.
“Also,” said the Englishman, “the Philosopher’s Stone has a fascinating property. A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold.”
Having heard that, the boy became even more interested in alchemy. He thought that, with some patience, he’d be able to transform everything into gold. He read the lives of the various people who had succeeded in doing so: Helvétius, Elias, Fulcanelli, and Geber. They were fascinating stories: each of them lived out his Personal Legend to the end. They traveled, spoke with wise men, performed miracles for the incredulous, and owned the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life.
But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master Work, he became completely lost. There were just drawings, coded instructions, and obscure texts.
“WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED?” HE asked the Englishman one night. The boy had noticed that the Englishman was irritable, and missed his books.
“So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand,” he said. “Imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold. Gold would lose its value.
“It’s only those who are persistent, and willing to study things deeply, who achieve the Master Work. That’s why I’m here in the middle of the desert. I’m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes.”
“When were these books written?” the boy asked.
“Many centuries ago.”
“They didn’t have the printing press in those days,” the boy argued. “There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy. Why did they use such strange language, with so many drawings?”
The Englishman didn’t answer him directly. He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan operated, but that he hadn’t learned anything new. The only thing he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent.
THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE Englishman. “Did you learn anything?” the Englishman asked, eager to hear what it might be. He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war.
“I learned that the world has a soul, and that whoever understands that soul can also understand the language of things. I learned that many alchemists realized their Personal Legends, and
wound up discovering the Soul of the World, the Philosopher’s Stone, and the Elixir of Life.
“But, above all, I learned that these things are all so simple that they could be written on the surface of an emerald.”
The Englishman was disappointed. The years of research, the magic symbols, the strange words, and the laboratory equipment…none of this had made an impression on the boy. His soul must be too primitive to understand those things, he thought.
He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags.
“Go back to watching the caravan,” he said. “That didn’t teach me anything, either.”
The boy went back to contemplating the silence of the desert, and the sand raised by the animals. “Everyone has his or her own way of learning things,” he said to himself. “His way isn’t the same as mine, nor mine as his. But we’re both in search of our Personal Legends, and I respect him for that.”
THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT. THE hooded Bedouins reappeared more and more frequently, and the camel driver—who had become a good friend of the boy’s—explained that the war between the tribes had already begun. The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis.
The animals were exhausted, and the men talked among themselves less and less. The silence was the worst aspect of the night, when the mere groan of a camel—which before had been nothing but the groan of a camel—now frightened everyone, because it might signal a raid.
The camel driver, though, seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war.
“I’m alive,” he said to the boy, as they ate a bunch of dates one night, with no fires and no moon. “When I’m eating, that’s all I think about. If I’m on the march, I just concentrate on marching. If I have to fight, it will be just as good a day to die as any other.
“Because I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man. You’ll see that there is life in the desert, that there are stars in the heavens, and that tribesmen fight because they are part of the human race. Life will be a party for you, a grand festival, because life is the moment we’re living right now.”
Two nights later, as he was getting ready to bed down, the boy looked for the star they followed every night. He thought that the horizon was a bit lower than it had been, because he seemed to see stars on the desert itself.
“It’s the oasis,” said the camel driver.
“Well, why don’t we go there right now?” the boy asked.
“Because we have to sleep.”
THE BOY AWOKE AS THE SUN ROSE. THERE, IN FRONT OF him, where the small stars had been the night before, was an endless row of date palms, stretching across the entire desert.
“We’ve done it!” said the Englishman, who had also awakened early.
But the boy was quiet. He was at home with the silence of the desert, and he was content just to look at the trees. He still had a long way to go to reach the Pyramids, and someday this morning
would just be a memory. But this was the present moment—the party the camel driver had mentioned—and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future. Although the vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory, right now it signified shade, water, and a refuge from the war. Yesterday, the camel’s groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms could herald a miracle.
The world speaks many languages, the boy thought.
THE TIMES RUSH PAST, AND SO DO THE CARAVANS, thought the alchemist, as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the oasis. People were shouting at the new arrivals, dust obscured the desert sun, and the children of the oasis were bursting with excitement at the arrival of the strangers. The alchemist saw the tribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan, and converse with him at length.
But none of that mattered to the alchemist. He had already seen many people come and go, and the desert remained as it was. He had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands. The dunes were changed constantly by the wind, yet these were the same sands he had known since he was a child. He always enjoyed seeing the happiness that the travelers experienced when, after weeks of yellow sand and blue sky, they first saw the green of the date palms. Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date trees, he thought.
He decided to concentrate on more practical matters. He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets. The omens had told him so. He didn’t know the man
yet, but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared. He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice.
I don’t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth, he thought. It wasn’t exactly that they were secrets; God revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures.
He had only one explanation for this fact: things have to be transmitted this way because they were made up from the pure life, and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words.
Because people become fascinated with pictures and words, and wind up forgetting the Language of the World.
THE BOY COULDN’T BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS SEEING: THE oasis, rather than being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees—as he had seen once in a geography book—was much larger than many towns back in Spain. There were three hundred wells, fifty thousand date trees, and innumerable colored tents spread among them.
“It looks like A Thousand and One Nights,” said the Englishman, impatient to meet with the alchemist.
They were surrounded by children, curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving. The men of the oasis wanted to know if they had seen any fighting, and the women competed with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants. The silence of the desert was a distant dream; the travelers in the caravan were talking incessantly, laughing and shouting, as if they had emerged from the spiritual world and found themselves once again in the world of people. They were relieved and happy.
They had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always considered to be neutral territories, because the majority of the inhabitants were women and children. There were oases throughout the desert, but the tribesmen fought in the desert, leaving the oases as places of refuge.
With some difficulty, the leader of the caravan brought all his people together and gave them his instructions. The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was over. Since they were visitors, they would have to share living space with those who lived there, and would be given the best accommodations. That was the law of hospitality. Then he asked that everyone, including his own sentinels, hand over their arms to the men appointed by the tribal chieftains.
“Those are the rules of war,” the leader explained. “The oases may not shelter armies or troops.”
To the boy’s surprise, the Englishman took a chrome-plated revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms.
“Why a revolver?” he asked.
“It helped me to trust in people,” the Englishman answered.
Meanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure. The closer he got to the realization of his dream, the more difficult things became. It seemed as if what the old king had called “beginner’s luck” were no longer functioning. In his pursuit of the dream, he was being constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage. So he could not be hasty, nor impatient. If he pushed forward impulsively, he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path.
God placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with the thought. Until then, he had considered the omens to be things of
this world. Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a job. He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do.
“Don’t be impatient,” he repeated to himself. “It’s like the camel driver said: ‘Eat when it’s time to eat. And move along when it’s time to move along.’”
That first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the Englishman. The boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a tent with five other young men of about his age. They were people of the desert, and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities.
The boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent.
“I’ve been looking for you all morning,” he said, as he led the boy outside. “I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives.”
First, they tried to find him on their own. An alchemist would probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the people at the oasis, and it was likely that in his tent an oven was continuously burning. They searched everywhere, and found that the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined; there were hundreds of tents.
“We’ve wasted almost the entire day,” said the Englishman, sitting down with the boy near one of the wells.
“Maybe we’d better ask someone,” the boy suggested.
The Englishman didn’t want to tell others about his reasons for being at the oasis, and couldn’t make up his mind. But, finally, he agreed that the boy, who spoke better Arabic than he, should do so. The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water.
“Good afternoon, ma’am. I’m trying to find out where the alchemist lives here at the oasis.”
The woman said she had never heard of such a person, and hurried away. But before she fled, she advised the boy that he had better not try to converse with women who were dressed in black, because they were married women. He should respect tradition.
The Englishman was disappointed. It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing. The boy was also saddened; his friend was in pursuit of his Personal Legend. And, when someone was in such pursuit, the entire universe made an effort to help him succeed—that’s what the old king had said. He couldn’t have been wrong.
“I had never heard of alchemists before,” the boy said. “Maybe no one here has, either.”
The Englishman’s eyes lit up. “That’s it! Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is! Find out who it is who cures the people’s illnesses!”
Several women dressed in black came to the well for water, but the boy would speak to none of them, despite the Englishman’s insistence. Then a man approached.
“Do you know someone here who cures people’s illnesses?” the boy asked.
“Allah cures our illnesses,” said the man, clearly frightened of the strangers. “You’re looking for witch doctors.” He spoke some verses from the Koran, and moved on.
Another man appeared. He was older, and was carrying a small bucket. The boy repeated his question.
“Why do you want to find that sort of person?” the Arab asked.
“Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to meet with him,” the boy said.
“If such a man is here at the oasis, he must be the very powerful one,” said the old man after thinking for a few moments. “Not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to. Only when he consents.
“Wait for the end of the war. Then leave with the caravan. Don’t try to enter into the life of the oasis,” he said, and walked away.
But the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track.
Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. She had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist.
At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him. When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke—the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at the well. She smiled, and that was certainly an omen—the omen he had been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life. The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.
It was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time. What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. He was more certain of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person
before becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language. Because, when you know that language, it’s easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether it’s in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such love, one’s dreams would have no meaning.
Maktub, thought the boy.
The Englishman shook the boy: “Come on, ask her!”
The boy stepped closer to the girl, and when she smiled, he did the same.
“What’s your name?” he asked.
“Fatima,” the girl said, averting her eyes.
“That’s what some women in my country are called.”
“It’s the name of the Prophet’s daughter,” Fatima said. “The invaders carried the name everywhere.” The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride.
The Englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the man who cured people’s illnesses.
“That’s the man who knows all the secrets of the world,” she said. “He communicates with the genies of the desert.”
The genies were the spirits of good and evil. And the girl pointed to the south, indicating that it was there the strange man lived. Then she filled her vessel with water and left.
The Englishman vanished, too, gone to find the alchemist. And the boy sat there by the well for a long time, remembering that one day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that
woman, and realizing that he had loved her before he even knew she existed. He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world.
The next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl. To his surprise, the Englishman was there, looking out at the desert.
“I waited all afternoon and evening,” he said. “He appeared with the first stars of evening. I told him what I was seeking, and he asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold. I told him that was what I had come here to learn.
“He told me I should try to do so. That’s all he said: ‘Go and try.’”
The boy didn’t say anything. The poor Englishman had traveled all this way, only to be told that he should repeat what he had already done so many times.
“So, then try,” he said to the Englishman.
“That’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to start now.”
As the Englishman left, Fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water.
“I came to tell you just one thing,” the boy said. “I want you to be my wife. I love you.”
The girl dropped the container, and the water spilled.
“I’m going to wait here for you every day. I have crossed the desert in search of a treasure that is somewhere near the Pyramids, and for me, the war seemed a curse. But now it’s a blessing, because it brought me to you.”
“The war is going to end someday,” the girl said.
The boy looked around him at the date palms. He reminded himself that he had been a shepherd, and that he could be a shepherd again. Fatima was more important than his treasure.
“The tribesmen are always in search of treasure,” the girl said, as if she had guessed what he was thinking. “And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen.”
She refilled her vessel and left.
The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima. He told her about his life as a shepherd, about the king, and about the crystal shop. They became friends, and except for the fifteen minutes he spent with her, each day seemed that it would never pass. When he had been at the oasis for almost a month, the leader of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him.
“We don’t know when the war will end, so we can’t continue our journey,” he said. “The battles may last for a long time, perhaps even years. There are powerful forces on both sides, and the war is important to both armies. It’s not a battle of good against evil. It’s a war between forces that are fighting for the balance of power, and, when that type of battle begins, it lasts longer than others—because Allah is on both sides.”
The people went back to where they were living, and the boy went to meet with Fatima that afternoon. He told her about the morning’s meeting. “The day after we met,” Fatima said, “you told me that you loved me. Then, you taught me something of the universal language and the Soul of the World. Because of that, I have become a part of you.”
The boy listened to the sound of her voice, and thought it to be more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms.
“I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time. I have forgotten about my past, about my traditions, and the way in which men of the desert expect women to behave. Ever since I was a
child, I have dreamed that the desert would bring me a wonderful present. Now, my present has arrived, and it’s you.”
The boy wanted to take her hand. But Fatima’s hands held to the handles of her jug.
“You have told me about your dreams, about the old king and your treasure. And you’ve told me about omens. So now, I fear nothing, because it was those omens that brought you to me. And I am a part of your dream, a part of your Personal Legend, as you call it.
“That’s why I want you to continue toward your goal. If you have to wait until the war is over, then wait. But if you have to go before then, go on in pursuit of your dream. The dunes are changed by the wind, but the desert never changes. That’s the way it will be with our love for each other.
“Maktub,” she said. “If I am really a part of your dream, you’ll come back one day.”
The boy was sad as he left her that day. He thought of all the married shepherds he had known. They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields. Love required them to stay with the people they loved.
He told Fatima that, at their next meeting.
“The desert takes our men from us, and they don’t always return,” she said. “We know that, and we are used to it. Those who don’t return become a part of the clouds, a part of the animals that hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth. They become a part of everything…they become the Soul of the World.
“Some do come back. And then the other women are happy because they believe that their men may one day return, as well. I used to look at those women and envy them their happiness. Now, I too will be one of the women who wait.
“I’m a desert woman, and I’m proud of that. I want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes. And, if I have to, I will accept the fact that he has become a part of the clouds, and the animals, and the water of the desert.”
The boy went to look for the Englishman. He wanted to tell him about Fatima. He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman had built himself a furnace outside his tent. It was a strange furnace, fueled by firewood, with a transparent flask heating on top. As the Englishman stared out at the desert, his eyes seemed brighter than they had when he was reading his books.
“This is the first phase of the job,” he said. “I have to separate out the sulfur. To do that successfully, I must have no fear of failure. It was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master Work. Now, I’m beginning what I could have started ten years ago. But I’m happy at least that I didn’t wait twenty years.”
He continued to feed the fire, and the boy stayed on until the desert turned pink in the setting sun. He felt the urge to go out into the desert, to see if its silence held the answers to his questions.
He wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight. He listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his feet. Here and there, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in remote times, had been a sea. He sat on a stone, and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon. He tried to deal with the concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldn’t separate them. But Fatima was a woman of the desert, and, if anything could help him to understand, it was the desert.
As he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him. Looking up, he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky.
He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind. Although their flight appeared to have no pattern, it made a certain kind of
sense to the boy. It was just that he couldn’t grasp what it meant. He followed the movement of the birds, trying to read something into it. Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership.
He felt sleepy. In his heart, he wanted to remain awake, but he also wanted to sleep. “I am learning the Language of the World, and everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me…even the flight of the hawks,” he said to himself. And, in that mood, he was grateful to be in love. When you are in love, things make even more sense, he thought.
Suddenly, one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky, attacking the other. As it did so, a sudden, fleeting image came to the boy: an army, with its swords at the ready, riding into the oasis. The vision vanished immediately, but it had shaken him. He had heard people speak of mirages, and had already seen some himself: they were desires that, because of their intensity, materialized over the sands of the desert. But he certainly didn’t desire that an army invade the oasis.
He wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his meditation. He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert, and its stones. But there was something there in his heart that wouldn’t allow him to do so.
“Always heed the omens,” the old king had said. The boy recalled what he had seen in the vision, and sensed that it was actually going to occur.
He rose, and made his way back toward the palm trees. Once again, he perceived the many languages in the things about him: this time, the desert was safe, and it was the oasis that had become dangerous.
The camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree, observing the sunset. He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes.
“An army is coming,” the boy said. “I had a vision.”
“The desert fills men’s hearts with visions,” the camel driver answered.
But the boy told him about the hawks: that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World.
The camel driver understood what the boy was saying. He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history of all things. One could open a book to any page, or look at a person’s hand; one could turn a card, or watch the flight of the birds…whatever the thing observed, one could find a connection with his experience of the moment. Actually, it wasn’t that those things, in themselves, revealed anything at all; it was just that people, looking at what was occurring around them, could find a means of penetration to the Soul of the World.
The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World. They were known as seers, and they were held in fear by women and the elderly. Tribesmen were also wary of consulting them, because it would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was fated to die. The tribesmen preferred the taste of battle, and the thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be; the future was already written by Allah, and what he had written was always for the good of man. So the tribesmen lived only for the present, because the present was full of surprises, and they had to be aware of many things: Where was the enemy’s sword? Where was his horse? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to
remain alive? The camel driver was not a fighter, and he had consulted with seers. Many of them had been right about what they said, while some had been wrong. Then, one day, the oldest seer he had ever sought out (and the one most to be feared) had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future.
“Well…so I can do things,” he had responded. “And so I can change those things that I don’t want to happen.”
“But then they wouldn’t be a part of your future,” the seer had said.
“Well, maybe I just want to know the future so I can prepare myself for what’s coming.”
“If good things are coming, they will be a pleasant surprise,” said the seer. “If bad things are, and you know in advance, you will suffer greatly before they even occur.”
“I want to know about the future because I’m a man,” the camel driver had said to the seer. “And men always live their lives based on the future.”
The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs; he threw them on the ground, and made interpretations based on how they fell. That day, he didn’t make a cast. He wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put them back in his bag.
“I make my living forecasting the future for people,” he said. “I know the science of the twigs, and I know how to use them to penetrate to the place where all is written. There, I can read the past, discover what has already been forgotten, and understand the omens that are here in the present.
“When people consult me, it’s not that I’m reading the future; I am guessing at the future. The future belongs to God, and it is only he who reveals it, under extraordinary circumstances. How do I guess at the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is
here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better. Forget about the future, and live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.”
The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future.
“Only when he, himself, reveals it. And God only rarely reveals the future. When he does so, it is for only one reason: it’s a future that was written so as to be altered.”
God had shown the boy a part of the future, the camel driver thought. Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument?
“Go and speak to the tribal chieftains,” said the camel driver. “Tell them about the armies that are approaching.”
“They’ll laugh at me.”
“They are men of the desert, and the men of the desert are used to dealing with omens.”
“Well, then, they probably already know.”
“They’re not concerned with that right now. They believe that if they have to know about something Allah wants them to know, someone will tell them about it. It has happened many times before. But, this time, the person is you.”
The boy thought of Fatima. And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes.
THE BOY APPROACHED THE GUARD AT THE FRONT OF THE huge white tent at the center of the oasis.
“I want to see the chieftains. I’ve brought omens from the desert.”
Without responding, the guard entered the tent, where he remained for some time. When he emerged, it was with a young Arab, dressed in white and gold. The boy told the younger man what he had seen, and the man asked him to wait there. He disappeared into the tent.
Night fell, and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent. One by one, the campfires were extinguished, and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert. Only the lights in the great tent remained. During all this time, the boy thought about Fatima, and he was still unable to understand his last conversation with her.
Finally, after hours of waiting, the guard bade the boy enter. The boy was astonished by what he saw inside. Never could he have imagined that, there in the middle of the desert, there existed a tent like this one. The ground was covered with the most beautiful carpets he had ever walked upon, and from the top of the structure hung lamps of handwrought gold, each with a lighted candle. The tribal chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle, resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions. Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea. Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs. The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke.
There were eight chieftains, but the boy could see immediately which of them was the most important: an Arab dressed in white and gold, seated at the center of the semicircle. At his side was the young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier.
“Who is this stranger who speaks of omens?” asked one of the chieftains, eyeing the boy.
“It is I,” the boy answered. And he told what he had seen.
“Why would the desert reveal such things to a stranger, when it knows that we have been here for generations?” said another of the chieftains.
“Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert,” the boy said. “I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see.”
And also because I know about the Soul of the World, he thought to himself.
“The oasis is neutral ground. No one attacks an oasis,” said a third chieftain.
“I can only tell you what I saw. If you don’t want to believe me, you don’t have to do anything about it.”
The men fell into an animated discussion. They spoke in an Arabic dialect that the boy didn’t understand, but, when he made to leave, the guard told him to stay. The boy became fearful; the omens told him that something was wrong. He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert.
Suddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly, and the boy felt better. The man hadn’t participated in the discussion, and, in fact, hadn’t said a word up to that point. But the boy was already used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent. Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming.
The discussion ended. The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying. Then he turned to the boy: this time his expression was cold and distant.
“Two thousand years ago, in a distant land, a man who believed in dreams was thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave,” the old man said, now in the dialect the boy understood. “Our
merchants bought that man, and brought him to Egypt. All of us know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them.”
The elder continued, “When the pharaoh dreamed of cows that were thin and cows that were fat, this man I’m speaking of rescued Egypt from famine. His name was Joseph. He, too, was a stranger in a strange land, like you, and he was probably about your age.”
He paused, and his eyes were still unfriendly.
“We always observe the Tradition. The Tradition saved Egypt from famine in those days, and made the Egyptians the wealthiest of peoples. The Tradition teaches men how to cross the desert, and how their children should marry. The Tradition says that an oasis is neutral territory, because both sides have oases, and so both are vulnerable.”
No one said a word as the old man continued.
“But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert. Everything we know was taught to us by the desert.”
The old man gave a signal, and everyone stood. The meeting was over. The hookahs were extinguished, and the guards stood at attention. The boy made ready to leave, but the old man spoke again:
“Tomorrow, we are going to break the agreement that says that no one at the oasis may carry arms. Throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies. When the sun sets, the men will once again surrender their arms to me. For every ten dead men among our enemies, you will receive a piece of gold.
“But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle. Arms are as capricious as the desert, and, if they are not used, the next time they might not function. If at least one of them hasn’t been used by the end of the day tomorrow, one will be used on you.”
When the boy left the tent, the oasis was illuminated only by the light of the full moon. He was twenty minutes from his tent, and began to make his way there.
He was alarmed by what had happened. He had succeeded in reaching through to the Soul of the World, and now the price for having done so might be his life. It was a frightening bet. But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to pursue his Personal Legend. And, as the camel driver had said, to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day. Every day was there to be lived or to mark one’s departure from this world. Everything depended on one word: “Maktub.”
Walking along in the silence, he had no regrets. If he died tomorrow, it would be because God was not willing to change the future. He would at least have died after having crossed the strait, after having worked in a crystal shop, and after having known the silence of the desert and Fatima’s eyes. He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago. If he died tomorrow, he would already have seen more than other shepherds, and he was proud of that.
Suddenly he heard a thundering sound, and he was thrown to the ground by a wind such as he had never known. The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view. Before him was an enormous white horse, rearing over him with a frightening scream.
When the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at what he saw. Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in black, with a falcon perched on his left shoulder. He wore a turban and his entire face, except for his eyes, was covered with a black kerchief. He appeared to be a messenger from the
desert, but his presence was much more powerful than that of a mere messenger.
The strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle. The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon.
“Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks?” he demanded, so loudly that his words seemed to echo through the fifty thousand palm trees of Al-Fayoum.
“It is I who dared to do so,” said the boy. He was reminded of the image of Santiago Matamoros, mounted on his white horse, with the infidels beneath his hooves. This man looked exactly the same, except that now the roles were reversed.
“It is I who dared to do so,” he repeated, and he lowered his head to receive a blow from the sword. “Many lives will be saved, because I was able to see through to the Soul of the World.”
The sword didn’t fall. Instead, the stranger lowered it slowly, until the point touched the boy’s forehead. It drew a droplet of blood.
The horseman was completely immobile, as was the boy. It didn’t even occur to the boy to flee. In his heart, he felt a strange sense of joy: he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend. And for Fatima. The omens had been true, after all. Here he was, face-to-face with his enemy, but there was no need to be concerned about dying—the Soul of the World awaited him, and he would soon be a part of it. And, tomorrow, his enemy would also be a part of that Soul.
The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy’s forehead. “Why did you read the flight of the birds?”
“I read only what the birds wanted to tell me. They wanted to save the oasis. Tomorrow all of you will die, because there are more men at the oasis than you have.”
The sword remained where it was. “Who are you to change what Allah has willed?”
“Allah created the armies, and he also created the hawks. Allah taught me the language of the birds. Everything has been written by the same hand,” the boy said, remembering the camel driver’s words.
The stranger withdrew the sword from the boy’s forehead, and the boy felt immensely relieved. But he still couldn’t flee.
“Be careful with your prognostications,” said the stranger. “When something is written, there is no way to change it.”
“All I saw was an army,” said the boy. “I didn’t see the outcome of the battle.”
The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer. But he kept the sword in his hand. “What is a stranger doing in a strange land?”
“I am following my Personal Legend. It’s not something you would understand.”
The stranger placed his sword in its scabbard, and the boy relaxed.
“I had to test your courage,” the stranger said. “Courage is the quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World.”
The boy was surprised. The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about.
“You must not let up, even after having come so far,” he continued. “You must love the desert, but never trust it completely. Because the desert tests all men: it challenges every step, and kills those who become distracted.”
What he said reminded the boy of the old king.
“If the warriors come here, and your head is still on your shoulders at sunset, come and find me,” said the stranger.
The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip. The horse reared again, raising a cloud of dust.
“Where do you live?” shouted the boy, as the horseman rode away.
The hand with the whip pointed to the south.
The boy had met the alchemist.
NEXT MORNING, THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMED men scattered throughout the palm trees at Al-Fayoum. Before the sun had reached its high point, five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon. The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north; it appeared to be a peaceful expedition, but they all carried arms hidden in their robes. When they reached the white tent at the center of Al-Fayoum, they withdrew their scimitars and rifles. And they attacked an empty tent.
The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead. The children had been kept at the other side of a grove of palm trees, and saw nothing of what had happened. The women had remained in their tents, praying for the safekeeping of their husbands, and saw nothing of the battle, either. Were it not for the bodies there on the ground, it would have appeared to be a normal day at the oasis.
The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion. That afternoon, he was brought before the tribal chieftains, who asked him why he had violated the Tradition. The commander said that his men had been starving and thirsty, exhausted from many
days of battle, and had decided to take the oasis so as to be able to return to the war.
The tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen, but that the Tradition was sacred. He condemned the commander to death without honor. Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet, he was hanged from a dead palm tree, where his body twisted in the desert wind.
The tribal chieftain called for the boy, and presented him with fifty pieces of gold. He repeated his story about Joseph of Egypt, and asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis.
WHEN THE SUN HAD SET, AND THE FIRST STARS MADE their appearance, the boy started to walk to the south. He eventually sighted a single tent, and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies. But the boy sat down and waited.
Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view. He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder.
“I am here,” the boy said.
“You shouldn’t be here,” the alchemist answered. “Or is it your Personal Legend that brings you here?”
“With the wars between the tribes, it’s impossible to cross the desert. So I have come here.”
The alchemist dismounted from his horse, and signaled that the boy should enter the tent with him. It was a tent like many at the oasis. The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy, but saw none. There were only some books in a pile, a small cooking stove, and the carpets, covered with mysterious designs.
“Sit down. We’ll have something to drink and eat these hawks,” said the alchemist.
The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen on the day before, but he said nothing. The alchemist lighted the fire, and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent. It was better than the scent of the hookahs.
“Why did you want to see me?” the boy asked.
“Because of the omens,” the alchemist answered. “The wind told me you would be coming, and that you would need help.”
“It’s not I the wind spoke about. It’s the other foreigner, the Englishman. He’s the one that’s looking for you.”
“He has other things to do first. But he’s on the right track. He has begun to try to understand the desert.”
“And what about me?”
“When a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream,” said the alchemist, echoing the words of the old king. The boy understood. Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend.
“So you are going to instruct me?”
“No. You already know all you need to know. I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure.”
“But there’s a tribal war,” the boy reiterated.
“I know what’s happening in the desert.”
“I have already found my treasure. I have a camel, I have my money from the crystal shop, and I have fifty gold pieces. In my own country, I would be a rich man.”
“But none of that is from the Pyramids,” said the alchemist.
“I also have Fatima. She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won.”
“She wasn’t found at the Pyramids, either.”
They ate in silence. The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy’s cup. It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted.
“Isn’t wine prohibited here?” the boy asked
“It’s not what enters men’s mouths that’s evil,” said the alchemist. “It’s what comes out of their mouths that is.”
The alchemist was a bit daunting, but, as the boy drank the wine, he relaxed. After they finished eating they sat outside the tent, under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale.
“Drink and enjoy yourself,” said the alchemist, noticing that the boy was feeling happier. “Rest well tonight, as if you were a warrior preparing for combat. Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure. You’ve got to find the treasure, so that everything you have learned along the way can make sense.
“Tomorrow, sell your camel and buy a horse. Camels are traitorous: they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire. Then suddenly, they kneel and die. But horses tire bit by bit. You always know how much you can ask of them, and when it is that they are about to die.”
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, THE BOY APPEARED AT THE alchemist’s tent with a horse. The alchemist was ready, and he mounted his own steed and placed the falcon on his left shoulder. He said to the boy, “Show me where there is life out in the desert. Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure.”
They began to ride out over the sands, with the moon lighting their way. I don’t know if I’ll be able to find life in the desert, the boy thought. I don’t know the desert that well yet.
He wanted to say so to the alchemist, but he was afraid of the man. They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the hawks in the sky, but now there was only silence and the wind.
“I don’t know how to find life in the desert,” the boy said. “I know that there is life here, but I don’t know where to look.”
“Life attracts life,” the alchemist answered.
And then the boy understood. He loosened the reins on his horse, who galloped forward over the rocks and sand. The alchemist followed as the boy’s horse ran for almost half an hour. They could no longer see the palms of the oasis—only the gigantic moon above them, and its silver reflections from the stones of the desert. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the boy’s horse began to slow.
“There’s life here,” the boy said to the alchemist. “I don’t know the language of the desert, but my horse knows the language of life.”
They dismounted, and the alchemist said nothing. Advancing slowly, they searched among the stones. The alchemist stopped abruptly, and bent to the ground. There was a hole there among the stones. The alchemist put his hand into the hole, and then his entire arm, up to his shoulder. Something was moving there, and the alchemist’s eyes—the boy could see only his eyes—squinted with his effort. His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole. Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his arm and leaped to his feet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail.
The boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist. The snake fought frantically, making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert. It was a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in minutes.
“Watch out for his venom,” the boy said. But even though the alchemist had put his hand in the hole, and had surely already been bitten, his expression was calm. “The alchemist is two hundred
years old,” the Englishman had told him. He must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert.
The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar. With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and then he placed the snake within it. The serpent relaxed immediately.
“Not to worry,” said the alchemist. “He won’t leave the circle. You found life in the desert, the omen that I needed.”
“Why was that so important?”
“Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert.”
The boy didn’t want to talk about the Pyramids. His heart was heavy, and he had been melancholy since the previous night. To continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima.
“I’m going to guide you across the desert,” the alchemist said.
“I want to stay at the oasis,” the boy answered. “I’ve found Fatima, and, as far as I’m concerned, she’s worth more than treasure.”
“Fatima is a woman of the desert,” said the alchemist. “She knows that men have to go away in order to return. And she already has her treasure: it’s you. Now she expects that you will find what it is you’re looking for.”
“Well, what if I decide to stay?”
“Let me tell you what will happen. You’ll be the counselor of the oasis. You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels. You’ll marry Fatima, and you’ll both be happy for a year. You’ll learn to love the desert, and you’ll get to know every one of the fifty thousand palms. You’ll watch them as they grow, demonstrating how the world is always changing. And you’ll get better and better at understanding omens, because the desert is the best teacher there is.
“Sometime during the second year, you’ll remember about the treasure. The omens will begin insistently to speak of it, and you’ll try to ignore them. You’ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants. The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do. And your camels will bring you wealth and power.
“During the third year, the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your Personal Legend. You’ll walk around, night after night, at the oasis, and Fatima will be unhappy because she’ll feel it was she who interrupted your quest. But you will love her, and she’ll return your love. You’ll remember that she never asked you to stay, because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man. So you won’t blame her. But many times you’ll walk the sands of the desert, thinking that maybe you could have left…that you could have trusted more in your love for Fatima. Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back. At that point, the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever.
“Then, sometime during the fourth year, the omens will abandon you, because you’ve stopped listening to them. The tribal chieftains will see that, and you’ll be dismissed from your position as counselor. But, by then, you’ll be a rich merchant, with many camels and a great deal of merchandise. You’ll spend the rest of your days knowing that you didn’t pursue your Personal Legend, and that now it’s too late.
“You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his Personal Legend. If he abandons that pursuit, it’s because it wasn’t true love…the love that speaks the Language of the World.”
The alchemist erased the circle in the sand, and the snake slithered away among the rocks. The boy remembered the crystal
merchant who had always wanted to go to Mecca, and the Englishman in search of the alchemist. He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert. And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved.
They mounted their horses, and this time it was the boy who followed the alchemist back to the oasis. The wind brought the sounds of the oasis to them, and the boy tried to hear Fatima’s voice.
But that night, as he had watched the cobra within the circle, the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of love and treasure, of the women of the desert and of his Personal Legend.
“I’m going with you,” the boy said. And he immediately felt peace in his heart.
“We’ll leave tomorrow before sunrise,” was the alchemist’s only response.
THE BOY SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT. TWO HOURS BEFORE dawn, he awoke one of the boys who slept in his tent, and asked him to show him where Fatima lived. They went to her tent, and the boy gave his friend enough gold to buy a sheep.
Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was sleeping, and to awaken her and tell her that he was waiting outside. The young Arab did as he was asked, and was given enough gold to buy yet another sheep.
“Now leave us alone,” said the boy to the young Arab. The Arab returned to his tent to sleep, proud to have helped the counselor of the oasis, and happy at having enough money to buy himself some sheep.
Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent. The two walked out among the palms. The boy knew that it was a violation of the Tradition, but that didn’t matter to him now.
“I’m going away,” he said. “And I want you to know that I’m coming back. I love you because…”
“Don’t say anything,” Fatima interrupted. “One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.”
But the boy continued, “I had a dream, and I met with a king. I sold crystal and crossed the desert. And, because the tribes declared war, I went to the well, seeking the alchemist. So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.”
The two embraced. It was the first time either had touched the other.
“I’ll be back,” the boy said.
“Before this, I always looked to the desert with longing,” said Fatima. “Now it will be with hope. My father went away one day, but he returned to my mother, and he has always come back since then.”
They said nothing else. They walked a bit farther among the palms, and then the boy left her at the entrance to her tent.
“I’ll return, just as your father came back to your mother,” he said.
He saw that Fatima’s eyes were filled with tears.
“You’re crying?”
“I’m a woman of the desert,” she said, averting her face. “But above all, I’m a woman.”
Fatima went back to her tent, and, when daylight came, she went out to do the chores she had done for years. But everything had changed. The boy was no longer at the oasis, and the oasis would never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday. It
would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three hundred wells, where the pilgrims arrived, relieved at the end of their long journeys. From that day on, the oasis would be an empty place for her.
From that day on, it was the desert that would be important. She would look to it every day, and would try to guess which star the boy was following in search of his treasure. She would have to send her kisses on the wind, hoping that the wind would touch the boy’s face, and would tell him that she was alive. That she was waiting for him, a woman awaiting a courageous man in search of his treasure. From that day on, the desert would represent only one thing to her: the hope for his return.
“DON’T THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU’VE LEFT BEHIND,” THE alchemist said to the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert. “Everything is written in the Soul of the World, and there it will stay forever.”
“Men dream more about coming home than about leaving,” the boy said. He was already reaccustomed to the desert’s silence.
“If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can always come back. If what you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return.”
The man was speaking the language of alchemy. But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima.
It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind. The desert, with its endless monotony, put him to dreaming. The boy could still see the palm trees, the wells, and the face of the woman
he loved. He could see the Englishman at his experiments, and the camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it. Maybe the alchemist has never been in love, the boy thought.
The alchemist rode in front, with the falcon on his shoulder. The bird knew the language of the desert well, and whenever they stopped, he flew off in search of game. On the first day he returned with a rabbit, and on the second with two birds.
At night, they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden. The desert nights were cold, and were becoming darker and darker as the phases of the moon passed. They went on for a week, speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to avoid the battles between the tribes. The war continued, and at times the wind carried the sweet, sickly smell of blood. Battles had been fought nearby, and the wind reminded the boy that there was the language of omens, always ready to show him what his eyes had failed to observe.
On the seventh day, the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual. The falcon flew off to find game, and the alchemist offered his water container to the boy.
“You are almost at the end of your journey,” said the alchemist. “I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend.”
“And you’ve told me nothing along the way,” said the boy. “I thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know. A while ago, I rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy. But I wasn’t able to learn anything from them.”
“There is only one way to learn,” the alchemist answered. “It’s through action. Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey. You need to learn only one thing more.”
The boy wanted to know what that was, but the alchemist was searching the horizon, looking for the falcon.
“Why are you called the alchemist?”
“Because that’s what I am.”
“And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so?”
“They were looking only for gold,” his companion answered. “They were seeking the treasure of their Personal Legend, without wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend.”
“What is it that I still need to know?” the boy asked.
But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon. And finally the falcon returned with their meal. They dug a hole and lit their fire in it, so that the light of the flames would not be seen.
“I’m an alchemist simply because I’m an alchemist,” he said, as he prepared the meal. “I learned the science from my grandfather, who learned from his father, and so on, back to the creation of the world. In those times, the Master Work could be written simply on an emerald. But men began to reject simple things, and to write tracts, interpretations, and philosophical studies. They also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had. Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today.”
“What was written on the Emerald Tablet?” the boy wanted to know.
The alchemist began to draw in the sand, and completed his drawing in less than five minutes. As he drew, the boy thought of the old king, and the plaza where they had met that day; it seemed as if it had taken place years and years ago.
“This is what was written on the Emerald Tablet,” said the alchemist, when he had finished.
The boy tried to read what was written in the sand.
“It’s a code,” said the boy, a bit disappointed. “It looks like what I saw in the Englishman’s books.”
“No,” the alchemist answered. “It’s like the flight of those two hawks; it can’t be understood by reason alone. The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World.
“The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise. The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect. God created the world so that, through its visible objects, men could understand his spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom. That’s what I mean by action.”
“Should I understand the Emerald Tablet?” the boy asked.
“Perhaps, if you were in a laboratory of alchemy, this would be the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet. But you are in the desert. So immerse yourself in it. The desert will give you an understanding of the world; in fact, anything on the face of the earth will do that. You don’t even have to understand the desert: all you have to do is contemplate a simple grain of sand, and you will see in it all the marvels of creation.”
“How do I immerse myself in the desert?”
“Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of the World, and it will one day return there.”
THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN silence. The alchemist had become much more cautious, because they were approaching the area where the most violent battles were being waged. As they moved along, the boy tried to listen to his heart.
It was not easy to do; in earlier times, his heart had always been ready to tell its story, but lately that wasn’t true. There had been times when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness, and at other
times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears. His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy of treasure, and more slowly when the boy stared entranced at the endless horizons of the desert. But his heart was never quiet, even when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence.
“Why do we have to listen to our hearts?” the boy asked, when they had made camp that day.
“Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you’ll find your treasure.”
“But my heart is agitated,” the boy said. “It has its dreams, it gets emotional, and it’s become passionate over a woman of the desert. It asks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when I’m thinking about her.”
“Well, that’s good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has to say.”
During the next three days, the two travelers passed by a number of armed tribesmen, and saw others on the horizon. The boy’s heart began to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard from the Soul of the World, stories of men who sought to find their treasure and never succeeded. Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that he might die there in the desert. At other times, it told the boy that it was satisfied: it had found love and riches.
“My heart is a traitor,” the boy said to the alchemist, when they had paused to rest the horses. “It doesn’t want me to go on.”
“That makes sense,” the alchemist answered. “Naturally it’s afraid that, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you’ve won.”
“Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?”
“Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there inside you, repeating to you what you’re thinking about life and about the world.”
“You mean I should listen, even if it’s treasonous?”
“Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your heart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you’ll know its dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them.
“You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it’s better to listen to what it has to say. That way, you’ll never have to fear an unanticipated blow.”
The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it as it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to the oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy. “Even though I complain sometimes,” it said, “it’s because I’m the heart of a person, and people’s hearts are that way. People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they don’t deserve them, or that they’ll be unable to achieve them. We, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go away forever, or of moments that could have been good but weren’t, or of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we suffer terribly.”
“My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,” the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky.
“Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second’s encounter with God and with eternity.”
“Every second of the search is an encounter with God,” the boy told his heart. “When I have been truly searching for my treasure, every day has been luminous, because I’ve known that every hour was a part of the dream that I would find it. When I have been truly searching for my treasure, I’ve discovered things along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve.”
So his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon. That night, the boy slept deeply, and, when he awoke, his heart began to tell him things that came from the Soul of the World. It said that all people who are happy have God within them. And that happiness could be found in a grain of sand from the desert, as the alchemist had said. Because a grain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe has taken millions of years to create it. “Everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him,” his heart said. “We, people’s hearts, seldom say much about those treasures, because people no longer want to go in search of them. We speak of them only to children. Later, we simply let life proceed, in its own direction, toward its own fate. But, unfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to their Personal Legends, and to happiness. Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place.
“So, we, their hearts, speak more and more softly. We never stop speaking out, but we begin to hope that our words won’t be heard: we don’t want people to suffer because they don’t follow their hearts.”
“Why don’t people’s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams?” the boy asked the alchemist.
“Because that’s what makes a heart suffer most, and hearts don’t like to suffer.”
From then on, the boy understood his heart. He asked it, please, never to stop speaking to him. He asked that, when he wandered far from his dreams, his heart press him and sound the alarm. The boy swore that, every time he heard the alarm, he would heed its message.
That night, he told all of this to the alchemist. And the alchemist understood that the boy’s heart had returned to the Soul of the World.
“So what should I do now?” the boy asked.
“Continue in the direction of the Pyramids,” said the alchemist. “And continue to pay heed to the omens. Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is.”
“Is that the one thing I still needed to know?”
“No,” the alchemist answered. “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which most people give up. It’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’
“Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”
The boy remembered an old proverb from his country. It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE FIRST CLEAR SIGN OF danger appeared. Three armed tribesmen approached, and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there.
“I’m hunting with my falcon,” the alchemist answered.
“We’re going to have to search you to see whether you’re armed,” one of the tribesmen said.
The alchemist dismounted slowly, and the boy did the same.
“Why are you carrying money?” asked the tribesman, when he had searched the boy’s bag.
“I need it to get to the Pyramids,” he said.
The tribesman who was searching the alchemist’s belongings found a small crystal flask filled with a liquid, and a yellow glass egg that was slightly larger than a chicken’s egg.
“What are these things?” he asked.
“That’s the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life. It’s the Master Work of the alchemists. Whoever swallows that elixir will never be sick again, and a fragment from that stone turns any metal into gold.”
The Arabs laughed at him, and the alchemist laughed along. They thought his answer was amusing, and they allowed the boy and the alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings.
“Are you crazy?” the boy asked the alchemist, when they had moved on. “What did you do that for?”
“To show you one of life’s simple lessons,” the alchemist answered. “When you possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.”
They continued across the desert. With every day that passed, the boy’s heart became more and more silent. It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future; it was content simply to contemplate the desert, and to drink with the boy from the Soul of
the World. The boy and his heart had become friends, and neither was capable now of betraying the other.
When his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a stimulus to the boy, and to give him strength, because the days of silence there in the desert were wearisome. His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were: his courage in having given up his sheep and in trying to live out his Personal Legend, and his enthusiasm during the time he had worked at the crystal shop.
And his heart told him something else that the boy had never noticed: it told the boy of dangers that had threatened him, but that he had never perceived. His heart said that one time it had hidden the rifle the boy had taken from his father, because of the possibility that the boy might wound himself. And it reminded the boy of the day when he had been ill and vomiting out in the fields, after which he had fallen into a deep sleep. There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy’s sheep and murder him. But, since the boy hadn’t passed by, they had decided to move on, thinking that he had changed his route.
“Does a man’s heart always help him?” the boy asked the alchemist.
“Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their Personal Legends. But they do help children, drunkards, and the elderly, too.”
“Does that mean that I’ll never run into danger?”
“It means only that the heart does what it can,” the alchemist said.
One afternoon, they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes. At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful white robes, with arms at the ready. The men were smoking their
hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield. No one paid any attention to the two travelers.
“There’s no danger,” the boy said, when they had moved on past the encampment.
The alchemist sounded angry: “Trust in your heart, but never forget that you’re in the desert. When men are at war with one another, the Soul of the World can hear the screams of battle. No one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun.”
All things are one, the boy thought. And then, as if the desert wanted to demonstrate that the alchemist was right, two horsemen appeared from behind the travelers.
“You can’t go any farther,” one of them said. “You’re in the area where the tribes are at war.”
“I’m not going very far,” the alchemist answered, looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen. They were silent for a moment, and then agreed that the boy and the alchemist could move along.
The boy watched the exchange with fascination. “You dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them,” he said.
“Your eyes show the strength of your soul,” answered the alchemist.
That’s true, the boy thought. He had noticed that, in the midst of the multitude of armed men back at the encampment, there had been one who stared fixedly at the two. He had been so far away that his face wasn’t even visible. But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them.
Finally, when they had crossed the mountain range that extended along the entire horizon, the alchemist said that they were only two days from the Pyramids.
“If we’re going to go our separate ways soon,” the boy said, “then teach me about alchemy.”
“You already know about alchemy. It is about penetrating to the Soul of the World, and discovering the treasure that has been reserved for you.”
“No, that’s not what I mean. I’m talking about transforming lead into gold.”
The alchemist fell as silent as the desert, and answered the boy only after they had stopped to eat.
“Everything in the universe evolved,” he said. “And, for wise men, gold is the metal that evolved the furthest. Don’t ask me why; I don’t know why. I just know that the Tradition is always right.
“Men have never understood the words of the wise. So gold, instead of being seen as a symbol of evolution, became the basis for conflict.”
“There are many languages spoken by things,” the boy said. “There was a time when, for me, a camel’s whinnying was nothing more than whinnying. Then it became a signal of danger. And, finally, it became just a whinny again.”
But then he stopped. The alchemist probably already knew all that.
“I have known true alchemists,” the alchemist continued. “They locked themselves in their laboratories, and tried to evolve, as gold had. And they found the Philosopher’s Stone, because they understood that when something evolves, everything around that thing evolves as well.
“Others stumbled upon the stone by accident. They already had the gift, and their souls were readier for such things than the souls of others. But they don’t count. They’re quite rare.
“And then there were the others, who were interested only in gold. They never found the secret. They forgot that lead, copper, and iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill. And anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own.”
The alchemist’s words echoed out like a curse. He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground.
“This desert was once a sea,” he said.
“I noticed that,” the boy answered.
The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear. He had done that many times when he was a child, and had heard the sound of the sea.
“The sea has lived on in this shell, because that’s its Personal Legend. And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water.”
They mounted their horses, and rode out in the direction of the Pyramids of Egypt.
THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THE BOY’S HEART SOUNDED a danger signal. They were surrounded by gigantic dunes, and the boy looked at the alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything. But he appeared to be unaware of any danger. Five minutes later, the boy saw two horsemen waiting ahead of them. Before he could say anything to the alchemist, the two horsemen had become ten, and then a hundred. And then they were everywhere in the dunes.
They were tribesmen dressed in blue, with black rings surrounding their turbans. Their faces were hidden behind blue veils, with only their eyes showing.
Even from a distance, their eyes conveyed the strength of their souls. And their eyes spoke of death.
THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP. A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff.
“These are the spies,” said one of the men.
“We’re just travelers,” the alchemist answered.
“You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago. And you were talking with one of the troops there.”
“I’m just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars,” said the alchemist. “I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes. I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here.”
“Who is your friend?” the chief asked.
“An alchemist,” said the alchemist. “He understands the forces of nature. And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers.”
The boy listened quietly. And fearfully.
“What is a foreigner doing here?” asked another of the men.
“He has brought money to give to your tribe,” said the alchemist, before the boy could say a word. And seizing the boy’s bag, the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief.
The Arab accepted them without a word. There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons.
“What is an alchemist?” he asked, finally.
“It’s a man who understands nature and the world. If he wanted to, he could destroy this camp just with the force of the wind.”
The men laughed. They were used to the ravages of war, and knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow. Yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster. They were men of the desert, and they were fearful of sorcerers.
“I want to see him do it,” said the chief.
“He needs three days,” answered the alchemist. “He is going to transform himself into the wind, just to demonstrate his powers. If he can’t do so, we humbly offer you our lives, for the honor of your tribe.”
“You can’t offer me something that is already mine,” the chief said, arrogantly. But he granted the travelers three days.
The boy was shaking with fear, but the alchemist helped him out of the tent.
“Don’t let them see that you’re afraid,” the alchemist said. “They are brave men, and they despise cowards.”
But the boy couldn’t even speak. He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp. There was no need to imprison them: the Arabs simply confiscated their horses. So, once again, the world had demonstrated its many languages: the desert only moments ago had been endless and free, and now it was an impenetrable wall.
“You gave them everything I had!” the boy said. “Everything I’ve saved in my entire life!”
“Well, what good would it be to you if you had to die?” the alchemist answered. “Your money saved us for three days. It’s not often that money saves a person’s life.”
But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom. He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind. He wasn’t an alchemist!
The alchemist asked one of the soldiers for some tea, and poured some on the boy’s wrists. A wave of relief washed over him, and the alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn’t understand.
“Don’t give in to your fears,” said the alchemist, in a strangely gentle voice. “If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.”
“But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind.”
“If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows everything he needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.”
“I’m not afraid of failing. It’s just that I don’t know how to turn myself into the wind.”
“Well, you’ll have to learn; your life depends on it.”
“But what if I can’t?”
“Then you’ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal Legend. That’s a lot better than dying like millions of other people, who never even knew what their Personal Legends were.
“But don’t worry,” the alchemist continued. “Usually the threat of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives.”
THE FIRST DAY PASSED. THERE WAS A MAJOR BATTLE nearby, and a number of wounded were brought back to the camp. The dead soldiers were replaced by others, and life went on. Death doesn’t change anything, the boy thought.
“You could have died later on,” a soldier said to the body of one of his companions. “You could have died after peace had been declared. But, in any case, you were going to die.”
At the end of the day, the boy went looking for the alchemist, who had taken his falcon out into the desert.
“I still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind,” the boy repeated.
“Remember what I told you: the world is only the visible aspect of God. And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane.”
“What are you doing?”
“Feeding my falcon.”
“If I’m not able to turn myself into the wind, we’re going to die,” the boy said. “Why feed your falcon?”
“You’re the one who may die,” the alchemist said. “I already know how to turn myself into the wind.”
ON THE SECOND DAY, THE BOY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A cliff near the camp. The sentinels allowed him to go; they had already heard about the sorcerer who could turn himself into the wind, and they didn’t want to go near him. In any case, the desert was impassable.
He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over the desert, and listening to his heart. The boy knew the desert sensed his fear.
They both spoke the same language.
ON THE THIRD DAY, THE CHIEF MET WITH HIS OFFICERS. He called the alchemist to the meeting and said, “Let’s go see the boy who turns himself into the wind.”
“Let’s,” the alchemist answered.
The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day. He told them all to be seated.
“It’s going to take awhile,” the boy said.
“We’re in no hurry,” the chief answered. “We are men of the desert.”
The boy looked out at the horizon. There were mountains in the distance. And there were dunes, rocks, and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible. There was the desert that he had wandered for so many months; despite all that time, he knew only a small part of it. Within that small part, he had found an Englishman, caravans, tribal wars, and an oasis with fifty thousand palm trees and three hundred wells.
“What do you want here today?” the desert asked him. “Didn’t you spend enough time looking at me yesterday?”
“Somewhere you are holding the person I love,” the boy said. “So, when I look out over your sands, I am also looking at her. I want to return to her, and I need your help so that I can turn myself into the wind.”
“What is love?” the desert asked.
“Love is the falcon’s flight over your sands. Because for him, you are a green field, from which he always returns with game. He knows your rocks, your dunes, and your mountains, and you are generous to him.”
“The falcon’s beak carries bits of me, myself,” the desert said. “For years, I care for his game, feeding it with the little water that I have, and then I show him where the game is. And, one day, as I enjoy the fact that his game thrives on my surface, the falcon dives out of the sky, and takes away what I’ve created.”
“But that’s why you created the game in the first place,” the boy answered. “To nourish the falcon. And the falcon then nourishes
man. And, eventually, man will nourish your sands, where the game will once again flourish. That’s how the world goes.”
“So is that what love is?”
“Yes, that’s what love is. It’s what makes the game become the falcon, the falcon become man, and man, in his turn, the desert. It’s what turns lead into gold, and makes the gold return to the earth.”
“I don’t understand what you’re talking about,” the desert said.
“But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me. And that’s why I have to turn myself into the wind.”
The desert didn’t answer him for a few moments.
Then it told him, “I’ll give you my sands to help the wind to blow, but, alone, I can’t do anything. You have to ask for help from the wind.”
A breeze began to blow. The tribesmen watched the boy from a distance, talking among themselves in a language that the boy couldn’t understand.
The alchemist smiled.
The wind approached the boy and touched his face. It knew of the boy’s talk with the desert, because the winds know everything. They blow across the world without a birthplace, and with no place to die.
“Help me,” the boy said. “One day you carried the voice of my loved one to me.”
“Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind?”
“My heart,” the boy answered.
The wind has many names. In that part of the world, it was called the sirocco, because it brought moisture from the oceans to the east. In the distant land the boy came from, they called it the
levanter, because they believed that it brought with it the sands of the desert, and the screams of the Moorish wars. Perhaps, in the places beyond the pastures where his sheep lived, men thought that the wind came from Andalusia. But, actually, the wind came from no place at all, nor did it go to any place; that’s why it was stronger than the desert. Someone might one day plant trees in the desert, and even raise sheep there, but never would they harness the wind.
“You can’t be the wind,” the wind said. “We’re two very different things.”
“That’s not true,” the boy said. “I learned the alchemist’s secrets in my travels. I have inside me the winds, the deserts, the oceans, the stars, and everything created in the universe. We were all made by the same hand, and we have the same soul. I want to be like you, able to reach every corner of the world, cross the seas, blow away the sands that cover my treasure, and carry the voice of the woman I love.”
“I heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist,” the wind said. “He said that everything has its own Personal Legend. But people can’t turn themselves into the wind.”
“Just teach me to be the wind for a few moments,” the boy said. “So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds.”
The wind’s curiosity was aroused, something that had never happened before. It wanted to talk about those things, but it didn’t know how to turn a man into the wind. And look how many things the wind already knew how to do! It created deserts, sank ships, felled entire forests, and blew through cities filled with music and strange noises. It felt that it had no limits, yet here was a boy saying that there were other things the wind should be able to do.
“This is what we call love,” the boy said, seeing that the wind was close to granting what he requested. “When you are loved, you can do anything in creation. When you are loved, there’s no need at all to understand what’s happening, because everything happens within you, and even men can turn themselves into the wind. As long as the wind helps, of course.”
The wind was a proud being, and it was becoming irritated with what the boy was saying. It commenced to blow harder, raising the desert sands. But finally it had to recognize that, even making its may around the world, it didn’t know how to turn a man into the wind. And it knew nothing about love.
“In my travels around the world, I’ve often seen people speaking of love and looking toward the heavens,” the wind said, furious at having to acknowledge its own limitations. “Maybe it’s better to ask heaven.”
“Well then, help me do that,” the boy said. “Fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun. Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself.”
So the wind blew with all its strength, and the sky was filled with sand. The sun was turned into a golden disk.
At the camp, it was difficult to see anything. The men of the desert were already familiar with that wind. They called it the simum, and it was worse than a storm at sea. Their horses cried out, and all their weapons were filled with sand.
On the heights, one of the commanders turned to the chief and said, “Maybe we had better end this!”
They could barely see the boy. Their faces were covered with the blue cloths, and their eyes showed fear.
“Let’s stop this,” another commander said.
“I want to see the greatness of Allah,” the chief said, with respect. “I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind.”
But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had expressed their fear. As soon as the wind stopped, he was going to remove them from their commands, because true men of the desert are not afraid.
“The wind told me that you know about love,” the boy said to the sun. “If you know about love, you must also know about the Soul of the World, because it’s made of love.”
“From where I am,” the sun said, “I can see the Soul of the World. It communicates with my soul, and together we cause the plants to grow and the sheep to seek out shade. From where I am—and I’m a long way from the earth—I learned how to love. I know that if I came even a little bit closer to the earth, everything there would die, and the Soul of the World would no longer exist. So we contemplate each other, and we want each other, and I give it life and warmth, and it gives me my reason for living.”
“So you know about love,” the boy said.
“And I know the Soul of the World, because we have talked at great length to each other during this endless trip through the universe. It tells me that its greatest problem is that, up until now, only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one. That there’s no need for iron to be the same as copper, or copper the same as gold. Each performs its own exact function as a unique being, and everything would be a symphony of peace if the hand that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation.
“But there was a sixth day,” the sun went on.
“You are wise, because you observe everything from a distance,” the boy said. “But you don’t know about love. If there hadn’t been a sixth day, man would not exist; copper would always be just copper,
and lead just lead. It’s true that everything has its Personal Legend, but one day that Personal Legend will be realized. So each thing has to transform itself into something better, and to acquire a new Personal Legend, until, someday, the Soul of the World becomes one thing only.”
The sun thought about that, and decided to shine more brightly. The wind, which was enjoying the conversation, started to blow with greater force, so that the sun would not blind the boy.
“This is why alchemy exists,” the boy said. “So that everyone will search for his treasure, find it, and then want to be better than he was in his former life. Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead; and then lead will have to turn itself into gold.
“That’s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.”
“Well, why did you say that I don’t know about love?” the sun asked the boy.
“Because it’s not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to roam the world like the wind. And it’s not love to see everything from a distance, like you do. Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World. When I first reached through to it, I thought the Soul of the World was perfect. But later, I could see that it was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and wars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the World, and the world we live in will be either better or worse, depending on whether we become better or worse. And that’s where the power of love comes in. Because when we love, we always strive to become better than we are.”
“So what do you want of me?” the sun asked.
“I want you to help me turn myself into the wind,” the boy answered.
“Nature knows me as the wisest being in creation,” the sun said. “But I don’t know how to turn you into the wind.”
“Then, whom should I ask?”
The sun thought for a minute. The wind was listening closely, and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun’s wisdom had its limitations. That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World.
“Speak to the hand that wrote all,” said the sun.
The wind screamed with delight, and blew harder than ever. The tents were being blown from their ties to the earth, and the animals were being freed from their tethers. On the cliff, the men clutched at each other as they sought to keep from being blown away.
The boy turned to the hand that wrote all. As he did so, he sensed that the universe had fallen silent, and he decided not to speak.
A current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to pray. It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a prayer without words or pleas. His prayer didn’t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures; it didn’t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal; and it didn’t beseech that the woman he had met continue to await his return. In the silence, the boy understood that the desert, the wind, and the sun were also trying to understand the signs written by the hand, and were seeking to follow their paths, and to understand what had been written on a single emerald. He saw that omens were scattered throughout the earth and in space, and that there was no reason or significance attached to their appearance; he could see that not the deserts, nor the winds, nor the sun, nor people knew why they had been created.
But that the hand had a reason for all of this, and that only the hand could perform miracles, or transform the sea into a desert…or a man into the wind. Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work.
The boy reached through to the Soul of the World, and saw that it was a part of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was his own soul. And that he, a boy, could perform miracles.
THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN before. For generations thereafter, the Arabs recounted the legend of a boy who had turned himself into the wind, almost destroying a military camp, in defiance of the most powerful chief in the desert.
When the simum ceased to blow, everyone looked to the place where the boy had been. But he was no longer there; he was standing next to a sand-covered sentinel, on the far side of the camp.
The men were terrified at his sorcery. But there were two people who were smiling: the alchemist, because he had found his perfect disciple, and the chief, because that disciple had understood the glory of God.
The following day, the general bade the boy and the alchemist farewell, and provided them with an escort party to accompany them as far as they chose.
THEY RODE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. TOWARD THE END OF the afternoon, they came upon a Coptic monastery. The alchemist dismounted, and told the escorts they could return to the camp.
“From here on, you will be alone,” the alchemist said. “You are only three hours from the Pyramids.”
“Thank you,” said the boy. “You taught me the Language of the World.”
“I only invoked what you already knew.”
The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery. A monk dressed in black came to the gates. They spoke for a few minutes in the Coptic tongue, and the alchemist bade the boy enter.
“I asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while,” the alchemist smiled.
They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery. The alchemist lighted the fire, and the monk brought him some lead, which the alchemist placed in an iron pan. When the lead had become liquid, the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg. He scraped from it a sliver as thin as a hair, wrapped it in wax, and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted.
The mixture took on a reddish color, almost the color of blood. The alchemist removed the pan from the fire, and set it aside to cool. As he did so, he talked with the monk about the tribal wars.
“I think they’re going to last for a long time,” he said to the monk.
The monk was irritated. The caravans had been stopped at Giza for some time, waiting for the wars to end. “But God’s will be done,” the monk said.
“Exactly,” answered the alchemist.
When the pan had cooled, the monk and the boy looked at it, dazzled. The lead had dried into the shape of the pan, but it was no longer lead. It was gold.
“Will I learn to do that someday?” the boy asked.
“This was my Personal Legend, not yours,” the alchemist answered. “But I wanted to show you that it was possible.”
They returned to the gates of the monastery. There, the alchemist separated the disk into four parts.
“This is for you,” he said, holding one of the parts out to the monk. “It’s for your generosity to the pilgrims.”
“But this payment goes well beyond my generosity,” the monk responded.
“Don’t say that again. Life might be listening, and give you less the next time.”
The alchemist turned to the boy. “This is for you. To make up for what you gave to the general.”
The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had given the general. But he kept quiet, because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk.
“And this is for me,” said the alchemist, keeping one of the parts. “Because I have to return to the desert, where there are tribal wars.”
He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk.
“This is for the boy. If he ever needs it.”
“But I’m going in search of my treasure,” the boy said. “I’m very close to it now.”
“And I’m certain you’ll find it,” the alchemist said.
“Then why this?”
“Because you have already lost your savings twice. Once to the thief, and once to the general. I’m an old, superstitious Arab, and I believe in our proverbs. There’s one that says, ‘Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.’” They mounted their horses.
“I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT DREAMS,” SAID THE alchemist.
The boy brought his horse closer.
“In ancient Rome, at the time of Emperor Tiberius, there lived a good man who had two sons. One was in the military, and had been sent to the most distant regions of the empire. The other son was a poet, and delighted all of Rome with his beautiful verses.
“One night, the father had a dream. An angel appeared to him, and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come. The father woke from his dream grateful and crying, because life was generous, and had revealed to him something any father would be proud to know.
“Shortly thereafter, the father died as he tried to save a child who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot. Since he had lived his entire life in a manner that was correct and fair, he went directly to heaven, where he met the angel that had appeared in his dream.
“‘You were always a good man,’ the angel said to him. ‘You lived your life in a loving way, and died with dignity. I can now grant you any wish you desire.’
“‘Life was good to me,’ the man said. ‘When you appeared in my dream, I felt that all my efforts had been rewarded, because my son’s poems will be read by men for generations to come. I don’t want anything for myself. But any father would be proud of the fame achieved by one whom he had cared for as a child, and educated as he grew up. Sometime in the distant future, I would like to see my son’s words.’
“The angel touched the man’s shoulder, and they were both projected far into the future. They were in an immense setting, surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language.
“The man wept with happiness.
“‘I knew that my son’s poems were immortal,’ he said to the angel through his tears. ‘Can you please tell me which of my son’s poems these people are repeating?’
“The angel came closer to the man, and, with tenderness, led him to a bench nearby, where they sat down.
“‘The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in Rome,’ the angel said. ‘Everyone loved them and enjoyed them. But when the reign of Tiberius ended, his poems were forgotten. The words you’re hearing now are those of your son in the military.’
“The man looked at the angel in surprise.
“‘Your son went to serve at a distant place, and became a centurion. He was just and good. One afternoon, one of his servants fell ill, and it appeared that he would die. Your son had heard of a rabbi who was able to cure illnesses, and he rode out for days and days in search of this man. Along the way, he learned that the man he was seeking was the Son of God. He met others who had been cured by him, and they instructed your son in the man’s teachings. And so, despite the fact that he was a Roman centurion, he converted to their faith. Shortly thereafter, he reached the place where the man he was looking for was visiting.’
“‘He told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill, and the rabbi made ready to go to his house with him. But the centurion was a man of faith, and, looking into the eyes of the rabbi, he knew that he was surely in the presence of the Son of God.’
“‘And this is what your son said,’ the angel told the man. ‘These are the words he said to the rabbi at that point, and they have never
been forgotten: “My Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. But only speak a word and my servant will be healed.””’
The alchemist said, “No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn’t know it.”
The boy smiled. He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd.
“Good-bye,” the alchemist said.
“Good-bye,” said the boy.
THE BOY RODE ALONG THROUGH THE DESERT FOR SEVERAL hours, listening avidly to what his heart had to say. It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden.
“Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,” the alchemist had told him.
But his heart was speaking of other things. With pride, it told the story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had on two different occasions. It told of Personal Legend, and of the many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful women, confronting the people of their times with their preconceived notions. It spoke of journeys, discoveries, books, and change.
As he was about to climb yet another dune, his heart whispered, “Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears. That’s where I am, and that’s where your treasure is.”
The boy climbed the dune slowly. A full moon rose again in the starry sky: it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis.
The moonlight cast shadows through the dunes, creating the appearance of a rolling sea; it reminded the boy of the day when that horse had reared in the desert, and he had come to know the alchemist. And the moon fell on the desert’s silence, and on a man’s journey in search of treasure.
When he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt. There, illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the desert, stood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt.
The boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making him believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to meet a king, a merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist. And above all for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend.
If he wanted to, he could now return to the oasis, go back to Fatima, and live his life as a simple shepherd. After all, the alchemist continued to live in the desert, even though he understood the Language of the World, and knew how to transform lead into gold. He didn’t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone. The boy told himself that, on the way toward realizing his own Personal Legend, he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced everything he might have dreamed of.
But here he was, at the point of finding his treasure, and he reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has been achieved. The boy looked at the sands around him, and saw that, where his tears had fallen, a scarab beetle was scuttling through the sand. During his time in the desert, he had learned that, in Egypt, the scarab beetles are a symbol of God.
Another omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so, he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone
could build a pyramid in his backyard. The boy could see now that he couldn’t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life.
Throughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, but found nothing. He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built. But he didn’t stop. He struggled to continue digging as he fought the wind, which often blew the sand back into the excavation. His hands were abraded and exhausted, but he listened to his heart. It had told him to dig where his tears fell.
As he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered, he heard footsteps. Several figures approached him. Their backs were to the moonlight, and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their faces.
“What are you doing here?” one of the figures demanded.
Because he was terrified, the boy didn’t answer. He had found where his treasure was, and was frightened at what might happen.
“We’re refugees from the tribal wars, and we need money,” the other figure said. “What are you hiding there?”
“I’m not hiding anything,” the boy answered.
But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole. Another, who was searching the boy’s bags, found the piece of gold.
“There’s gold here,” he said.
The moon shone on the face of the Arab who had seized him, and in the man’s eyes the boy saw death.
“He’s probably got more gold hidden in the ground.”
They made the boy continue digging, but he found nothing. As the sun rose, the men began to beat the boy. He was bruised and bleeding, his clothing was torn to shreds, and he felt that death was near.
“What good is money to you if you’re going to die? It’s not often that money can save someone’s life,” the alchemist had said. Finally, the boy screamed at the men, “I’m digging for treasure!” And, although his mouth was bleeding and swollen, he told his attackers that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt.
The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others: “Leave him. He doesn’t have anything else. He must have stolen this gold.”
The boy fell to the sand, nearly unconscious. The leader shook him and said, “We’re leaving.”
But before they left, he came back to the boy and said, “You’re not going to die. You’ll live, and you’ll learn that a man shouldn’t be so stupid. Two years ago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent dream, too. I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept. In my dream, there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the sacristy, and I was told that, if I dug at the roots of the sycamore, I would find a hidden treasure. But I’m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream.”
And they disappeared.
The boy stood up shakily, and looked once more at the Pyramids. They seemed to laugh at him, and he laughed back, his heart bursting with joy.
Because now he knew where his treasure was.
EPILOGUE
THE BOY REACHED THE SMALL, ABANDONED CHURCH JUST as night was falling. The sycamore was still there in the sacristy, and the stars could still be seen through the half-destroyed roof. He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep; it had been a peaceful night…except for the dream.
Now he was here not with his flock, but with a shovel.
He sat looking at the sky for a long time. Then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine, and drank some. He remembered the night in the desert when he had sat with the alchemist, as they looked at the stars and drank wine together. He thought of the many roads he had traveled, and of the strange way God had chosen to show him his treasure. If he hadn’t believed in the significance of recurrent dreams, he would not have met the Gypsy woman, the king, the thief, or…“Well, it’s a long list. But the path was written in the omens, and there was no way I could go wrong,” he said to himself.
He fell asleep, and when he awoke the sun was already high. He began to dig at the base of the sycamore.
“You old sorcerer,” the boy shouted up to the sky. “You knew the whole story. You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church. The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters. Couldn’t you have saved me from that?”
“No,” he heard a voice on the wind say. “If I had told you, you wouldn’t have seen the Pyramids. They’re beautiful, aren’t they?”
The boy smiled, and continued digging. Half an hour later, his shovel hit something solid. An hour later, he had before him a chest of Spanish gold coins. There were also precious stones, gold masks adorned with red and white feathers, and stone statues embedded with jewels. The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago forgotten, and that some conquistador had failed to tell his children about.
The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag. He had used the two stones only once, one morning when he was at a marketplace. His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens.
He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest. They were also a part of his new treasure, because they were a reminder of the old king, whom he would never see again.
It’s true; life really is generous to those who pursue their Personal Legend, the boy thought. Then he remembered that he had to get to Tarifa so he could give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy woman, as he had promised. Those Gypsies are really smart, he thought. Maybe it was because they moved around so much.
The wind began to blow again. It was the levanter, the wind that came from Africa. It didn’t bring with it the smell of the desert, nor the threat of Moorish invasion. Instead, it brought the scent of a perfume he knew well, and the touch of a kiss—a kiss that came from far away, slowly, slowly, until it rested on his lips.
The boy smiled. It was the first time she had done that.
“I’m coming, Fatima,” he said.
ABOUT THE AUTHOR
PAULO COELHO was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the city where he now lives. His own life has in many ways been as varied and unusual as the protagonists of his internationally acclaimed novels. Like them, Paulo Coelho has followed a dream in a quest for fulfillment. His own dream, to be a writer, met with frustration throughout much of his early adult life, a time in which he worked at various professions, some of them materially rewarding but spiritually unfulfilling. “I always knew,” he says, “that my Personal Legend, to use a term from alchemy, was to write.” He was thirty-eight when he published his first book.
In 1970, after deciding that law school was not for him, he traveled through much of South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe. Returning to Brazil after two years, he began a successful career as popular songwriter. In 1974, he was imprisoned for a short time by the military dictatorship then ruling in Brazil. In 1980, he experienced one of the defining moments of his life: he walked the five hundred-plus mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. On this ancient highway, used for centuries by pilgrims from France to get to the cathedral said to house the remains of St. James, he achieved a self-awareness and a spiritual awakening that he later described in The Pilgrimage.
Paulo Coelho once said that following your dream is like learning a foreign language; you will make mistakes but you will get there in the end. In 1988, he published The Alchemist, a novel that
explores this theme, and it launched him as an international bestselling author. Specifically, Paulo Coelho is recognized for his powerful storytelling technique and the profound spiritual insights he blends seamlessly into his parables. Since then, The Alchemist has sold more than twenty million copies worldwide and has been translated into some fifty-six languages. In addition to The Pilgrimage and The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho has written luminous novels about the different streams of our lives, including By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept, The Valkyries, The Fifth Mountain, and Veronika Decides to Die. A winner of numerous literary prizes, Paulo Coelho is also a prominent speaker for humanitarian causes. In 1999, he received a Crystal Award for Artistic Achievement at the Davos Economic Forum Conference.
International Acclaim for Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist
earth and spoke the ritual words. My wife drew near
and handed me the sword I had used for more than ten
years; it had been a great help to me during hundreds of
magical operations. I placed it in the hole I had dug,
covered it with dirt, and smoothed the surface. As I did
so, I thought of the many tests I had endured, of all I
had learned, and of the strange phenomena I had been
able to invoke simply because I had had that ancient
and friendly sword with me. Now it was to be devoured
by the earth, the iron of its blade and the wood of its
hilt returning to nourish the source from which its
power had come.
The Master approached me and placed my new
sword on the earth that now covered the grave of my
ancient one. All of us spread our arms wide, and the
Master, invoking his power, created a strange light that
surrounded us; it did not illuminate, but it was clearly
visible, and it caused the figures of those who were there
to take on a color that was different from the yellowish
tinge cast by the fire. Then, drawing his own sword, he
touched it to my shoulders and my forehead as he said,
‘By the power and the love of RAM, I anoint you Master
and Knight of the Order, now and for all the days of
your life. R for rigor, A for adoration, and M for mercy;
R for regnum, A for agnus, and M for mundi. Let not your
sword remain for long in its scabbard, lest it rust. And
when you draw your sword, it must never be replaced
without having performed an act of goodness, opened a
new path, or tasted the blood of an enemy.’

With the point of his sword, he lightly cut my forehead.
From then on, I was no longer required to remain
silent. No longer did I have to hide my capabilities nor
maintain secrecy regarding the marvels I had learned to
accomplish on the road of the Tradition. From that
moment on, I was a Magus.
I reached out to take my new sword of indestructible
steel and wood, with its black and red hilt and black
scabbard. But as my hands touched the scabbard and as
I prepared to pick it up, the Master came forward and
stepped on my fingers with all his might. I screamed
and let go of the sword.
I looked at him, astonished. The strange light had
disappeared, and his face had taken on a phantasmagoric
appearance, heightened by the flames of the
bonfire.
He returned my gaze coldly, called to my wife, and
gave her the sword, speaking a few words that I could
not hear. Turning to me, he said, ‘Take away your hand;
it has deceived you. The road of the Tradition is not for
the chosen few. It is everyone’s road. And the power that
you think you have is worthless, because it is a power
that is shared by all. You should have refused the sword.
If you had done so, it would have been given to you,
because you would have shown that your heart was
pure. But just as I feared, at the supreme moment you
stumbled and fell. Because of your avidity, you will now
have to seek again for your sword. And because of your
pride, you will have to seek it among simple people.

Because of your fascination with miracles, you will have
to struggle to recapture what was about to be given to
you so generously.’
The world seemed to fall away from me. I knelt there
unable to think about anything. Once I had returned
my old sword to the earth, I could not retrieve it. And
since the new one had not been given to me, I now had
to begin my quest for it all over again, powerless and
defenceless. On the day of my Celestial Ordination, my
Master’s violence had brought me back to earth.
The guide smothered the fire, and my wife helped
me up. She had my new sword in her hands, but according
to the rules of the Tradition, I could not touch it
without permission from my Master. We descended
through the forest in silence, following the guide’s
lantern, until we reached the narrow dirt road where the
cars were parked.
Nobody said good-bye. My wife put the sword in the
trunk of the car and started the engine. We were quiet
for a long time as she carefully navigated around the
bumps and holes in the road.
‘Don’t worry,’ she said, trying to encourage me. ‘I’m
sure you’ll get it back.’
I asked her what the Master had said to her.
‘He said three things to me. First, that he should
have brought along something warm to wear, because it
was much colder up there than he had expected.
Second, that he wasn’t surprised at anything that had
happened up there, that this has happened many times

before with others who have reached the same point as
you. And third, that your sword would be waiting for
you at the right time, on the right day, at some point on
the road that you will have to travel. I don’t know either
the day or the time. He only told me where I should
hide it.’
‘And what road was he talking about?’ I asked nervously.
‘Ah, well, that he didn’t explain very well. He just
said that you should look on the map of Spain for a
medieval route known as the Strange Road to Santiago.’

Arrival
The customs agent spent more time than usual examining
the sword that my wife had brought into the country
and then asked what we intended to do with it. I said that
a friend of ours was going to assess its value so that we
could sell it at auction. This lie worked: the agent gave us
a declaration stating that we had entered the country with
the sword at the Bajadas airport, and he told us that if we
had any problems trying to leave the country with it, we
need only show the declaration to the customs officials.
We went to the car rental agency and confirmed our
two vehicles. Armed with the rental documents, we had
a bite together at the airport restaurant prior to going
our separate ways.
We had spent a sleepless night on the plane – the
result of both a fear of flying and a sense of apprehension
about what was going to happen once we arrived –
but now we were excited and wide awake.
‘Not to worry,’ she said for the thousandth time.
‘You’re supposed to go to France and, at Saint-Jean-
Pied-de-Port, seek out Mme Lourdes. She is going to put
you in touch with someone who will guide you along
the Road to Santiago.’
9
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 9
‘And what about you?’ I asked, also for the thousandth
time, knowing what her answer would be.
‘I’m going where I have to go, and there I’ll leave
what has been entrusted to me. Afterward, I’ll spend a
few days in Madrid and then return to Brazil. I can take
care of things back there as well as you would.’
‘I know you can,’ I answered, wanting to avoid the
subject. I felt an enormous anxiety about the business
matters I had left behind in Brazil. I had learned all I
needed to know about the Road to Santiago in the fifteen
days following the incident in the Agulhas Negras,
but I had vacillated for another seven months before
deciding to leave everything behind and make the trip. I
had put it off until one morning when my wife had said
that the time was drawing near and that if I did not
make a decision, I might as well forget about the road
of the Tradition and the Order of RAM. I had tried to
explain to her that my Master had assigned me an
impossible task, that I couldn’t simply shrug off my
livelihood. She had smiled and said that my excuse was
dumb, that during the entire seven months I had done
nothing but ask myself night and day whether or not I
should go. And with the most casual of gestures, she
had held out the two airline tickets, with the flight
already scheduled.
‘We’re here because of your decision,’ I said glumly
now in the airport restaurant. ‘I don’t know if this will
even work, since I let another person make the decision
for me to seek out my sword.’

Paulo Coelho

My wife said that if we were going to start talking
nonsense, we had better say good-bye and go our separate
ways.
‘You have never in your life let another person make
an important decision for you. Let’s go. It’s getting late.’
She rose, picked up her suitcase, and headed for the
parking lot. I didn’t stop her. I stayed seated, observing
the casual way in which she carried my sword; at any
moment it seemed that it could slip from under her
arm.
She stopped suddenly, came back to the table, and
kissed me desperately. She looked at me for some time
without saying a word. This suddenly made me realize
that now I was actually in Spain and that there was no
going back. In spite of the knowledge that there were
many ways in which I could fail, I had taken the first
step. I hugged her passionately, trying to convey all the
love I felt for her at that moment. And while she was
still in my arms, I prayed to everything and everyone I
believed in, imploring that I be given the strength to
return to her with the sword.
‘That was a beautiful sword, wasn’t it?’ said a
woman’s voice from the next table, after my wife had
left.
‘Don’t worry,’ a man said. ‘I’ll buy one just like it for
you. The tourist shops here in Spain have thousands of
them.’
After I had driven for an hour or so, I began to feel
the fatigue accumulated from the night before. The
11
The Pilgrimage

August heat was so powerful that even on the open
highway, the car began to overheat. I decided to stop in
a small town identified by the road signs as
Monumento Nacional. As I climbed the steep road that
led to it, I began to review all that I had learned about
the Road to Santiago.
Just as the Muslin tradition requires that all members
of the faith, at least once in their life, make the
same pilgrimage that Muhammad made from Mecca to
Medina, so Christians in the first millennium considered
three routes to be sacred. Each of them offered a
series of blessings and indulgences to those who traveled
its length. The first led to the tomb of Saint Peter in
Rome; its travelers, who were called wanderers, took the
cross as their symbol. The second led to the Holy
Sepulcher of Christ in Jerusalem; those who took this
road were called Palmists, since they had as their
symbol the palm branches with which Jesus was greeted
when he entered that city. There was a third road, which
led to the mortal remains of the apostle, San Tiago –
Saint James in English, Jacques in French, Giacomo in
Italian, Jacob in Latin. He was buried at a place on the
Iberian peninsula where, one night, a shepherd had
seen a brilliant star above a field. The legend says that
not only San Tiago but also the Virgin Mary went there
shortly after the death of Christ, carrying the word of
the Evangelist and exhorting the people to convert. The
site came to be known as Compostela – the star field –
and there a city had arisen that drew travelers from
12
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 12
every part of the Christian world. These travelers were
called pilgrims, and their symbol was the scallop shell.
At the height of its fame, during the fourteenth century,
the Milky Way – another name for the third road,
since at night the pilgrims plotted their course using
this galaxy – was traveled each year by more than a million
people from every corner of Europe. Even today,
mystics, devotees, and researchers traverse on foot the
seven hundred kilometers that separate the French city
of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port from the cathedral of
Santiago de Compostela in Spain.*
Thanks to the French priest, Aymeric Picaud, who
walked to Compostela in 1123, the route followed by
the pilgrims today is exactly the same as the medieval
path taken by Charlemagne, Saint Francis of Assisi,
Isabella of Castile, and, most recently, by Pope John
XXIII.
Picaud wrote five books about his experience. They
were presented as the work of Pope Calixtus II – a devotee
of San Tiago – and they were later known as the
Codex Calixtinus. In Book Five of the codex, Picaud
identified the natural features, fountains, hospitals,
shelters, and cities found along the road. A special society
– ‘Les Amis de Saint-Jacques’ – was formed with the
13
The Pilgrimage
* The Road to Santiago, on the French side, comprised several
routes that joined at a Spanish city called Puente de la Reina. The
city of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port is located on one of those three
routes; it is neither the only one nor the most important.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 13
charge of maintaining all of the natural markings on the
route and helping to guide the pilgrims, using Picaud’s
annotations.
Also in the twelfth century, Spain began to capitalize
on the legend of San Tiago as the country fought against
the Moors who had invaded the peninsula. Several militant
religious orders were established along the Road to
Santiago, and the apostle’s ashes became a powerful
symbol in the fight against the Muslims. The Muslims,
in turn, claimed that they had with them one of
Muhammad’s arms and took that as their guiding
symbol. By the time Spain had regained control of the
country, the militant orders had become so strong that
they posed a threat to the nobility, and the Catholic
kings had to intervene directly to prevent the orders
from mounting an insurgency. As a result, the Road to
Santiago was gradually forgotten, and were it not for
sporadic artistic manifestations – in paintings such as
Buñuel’s The Milky Way and Juan Manoel Serrat’s
Wanderer – no one today would remember that millions
of the people who would one day settle the New World
had passed along that route.
The town that I reached by car was completely
deserted. After searching on foot for quite some time, I
finally found a small bar open for business in an old,
medieval-style house. The owner, who did not even
look up from the television program he was watching,
advised me that it was siesta time and suggested that I
must be crazy to be out walking in such heat.
14
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 14
I asked for a soft drink and tried to watch the television,
but I was unable to concentrate. All I could think
of was that in two days I was going to relive, here in the
latter part of the twentieth century, something of the
great human adventure that had brought Ulysses from
Troy, that had been a part of Don Quixote’s experience,
that had led Dante and Orpheus into hell, and that had
directed Columbus to the Americas: the adventure of
traveling toward the unknown.
By the time I returned to my car, I was a bit calmer.
Even if I were not able to find my sword, the pilgrimage
along the Road to Santiago was going to help me to find
myself.

Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port
A parade of masked people accompanied by a band –
all of them dressed in red, green, and white, the colors
of the French Basque region – filled the main street of
Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. It was Sunday. I had spent the
last two days driving, and now I was enjoying the festivities.
But it was time for my meeting with Mme Lourdes.
Forcing my way through the crowd by car, I heard some
shouted insults in French, but I finally made it through
to the fortified sector that constituted the oldest part of
the city, where Mme Lourdes lived. Even this high in the
Pyrenees, it was hot during the day, and I was soaked
with perspiration as I got out of the car.
I knocked at the gate. I knocked again, but there was
no response. A third time, and still nothing happened. I
felt confused and worried. My wife had said that I had
to arrive there exactly on that day, but no one answered
when I called out. I thought that perhaps Mme Lourdes
had gone out to watch the parade, but it was also possible
that I had arrived too late and that she had decided
not to meet with me. My journey along the Road to
Santiago seemed to have ended even before it had
begun.
17
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 17
Suddenly, the gate opened, and a child jumped
through it. I was startled, and in halting French I asked
for Mme Lourdes. The child smiled at me and pointed
toward the house. It was only then that I saw my mistake:
the gate led onto an immense courtyard, around
which were situated medieval houses with balconies.
The gate had been open, and I hadn’t even thought to
try its handle.
I ran across the courtyard and up to the house that
the child had indicated. Inside, an elderly, obese
woman yelled something in Basque at a small boy with
sad, brown eyes. I waited for a few moments, giving the
argument a chance to end; it finally did, with the poor
boy being sent to the kitchen under a hail of insults
from the old woman. It was only then that she turned
to me and, without even asking what it was that I
wanted, led me – with delicate gestures and slight
shoves – to the second floor of the small house. This
floor consisted of just one room: a small, crowded
office filled with books, objects, statues of San Tiago,
and memorabilia from the Road. She took a book from
its shelf and sat down behind the only table in the
room, leaving me standing.
‘You must be another pilgrim to Santiago,’ she said,
without preamble. ‘I need to enter your name in the register
of those who walk the Road.’
I gave her my name, and she wanted to know if I had
brought ‘the Scallops.’ She was referring to the shells
adopted as a symbol by pilgrims to the tomb of the
18
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 18
apostle; they served as a means of identification for the
pilgrims when they met.*
Before leaving for Spain, I had made a pilgrimage to
a place in Brazil called Aparecida do Norte. There, I had
purchased an image of Our Lady of the Visitation,
mounted on three scallop shells. I took it from my
knapsack and offered it to Mme Lourdes.
‘Pretty but not very practical,’ she said, handing it
back to me. ‘It could break during your pilgrimage.’
‘It’s not going to break. And I am going to leave it at
the tomb of the apostle.’
Mme Lourdes appeared not to have much time for
me. She gave me a small card that would help me to get
lodging at the monasteries along the Road, stamped it
with the seal of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port to indicate that I
had started the pilgrimage there, and said that I could
leave with God’s blessing.
‘But where is my guide?’ I asked.
‘What guide?’ she answered, a bit surprised but also
with a gleam in her eye.
I realized that I had forgotten something very important.
In my eagerness to arrive and be attended to, I had
neglected to say the Ancient Word – a kind of password
that identifies those who belong to the orders of the
Tradition. I immediately corrected my mistake and said
19
The Pilgrimage
* The Road to Santiago has made only one mark on French culture,
and that has been on that country’s national pride, gastronomy,
through the name ‘Coquilles Saint-Jacques.’
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 19
the word to her. In response, Mme Lourdes quickly
snatched from my hands the card she had given me a
few moments earlier.
‘You won’t be needing this,’ she said, as she moved a
pile of old newspapers that were sitting on top of a cardboard
box. ‘Your road and your stopping places will
depend on decisions made by your guide.’
Mme Lourdes took a hat and a cape from the box.
They seemed to be very old but well preserved. She asked
me to stand in the middle of the room, and she began
silently to pray. Then she placed the cape on my shoulders
and the hat on my head. I could see that scallop shells had
been sewn onto both the hat and the shoulders of the
cape. Without interrupting her prayers, the old woman
seized a shepherd’s crook from the corner of the room
and made me take it in my right hand. A small water
gourd hung from the crook. There I stood: dressed in
Bermuda shorts and a T-shirt that read ‘I LOVE NY,’ covered
by the medieval garb of the pilgrims to Compostela.
The old woman approached me and stopped only a
foot away. Then, in a kind of trance, placing the palms
of her hands on my head, she said, ‘May the apostle San
Tiago be with you, and may he show you the only thing
that you need to discover; may you walk neither too
slowly nor too fast but always according to the laws and
the requirements of the Road; may you obey the one
who is your guide, even though he may issue an order
that is homicidal, blasphemous, or senseless. You must
swear total obedience to your guide.’
20
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 20
I so swore.
‘The Spirit of the ancient pilgrims of the Tradition
must be with you during your journey. The hat will protect
you from the sun and from evil thoughts; the cape
will protect you from the rain and from evil words; the
gourd will protect you from enemies and from evil
deeds. May the blessing of God, of San Tiago, and of the
Virgin Mary be with you through all of your nights and
days. Amen.’
Having said this, she returned to her normal
manner; hurriedly and with a bit of irritation, she took
back the articles of clothing, placed them in the box,
and returned the crook with the gourd to the corner of
the room; then, after teaching me the password, she
asked me to leave, since my guide was waiting for me
two kilometers outside of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port.
‘He hates band music,’ she said. But even two kilometers
away he must have been able to hear it; the
Pyrenees are an excellent echo chamber.
Before I left, I asked what I should do with the car,
and she said I should leave the keys with her; someone
would come to pick it up. Then, without another word,
she descended the stairs and went to the kitchen to
inflict more torment on the boy with the sad eyes. I
opened the trunk of the car, took out my small blue
knapsack with my sleeping bag tied to it, and placed the
image of Our Lady of the Visitation in its most protected
corner. I put the knapsack on my back and went
back to give the keys to Mme Lourdes.
21
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 21
‘Leave Pied-de-Port by following this street to the
city gates at the end of the wall,’ she told me. ‘And when
you get to Santiago de Compostela, say a Hail Mary for
me. I have walked the Road so many times that now I
content myself with reading in other pilgrims’ eyes the
excitement that I still feel; I just can’t put it into practice
anymore because of my age. Tell that to San Tiago. And
tell him also that any time now I will join him, following
a different road that’s more direct and less exhausting.’
I left the small city, passing through the wall at the
Spanish Gate. In the past, the city had been on the preferred
route for the Roman invaders, and through that
gate had also passed the armies of Charlemagne and
Napoleon. I walked along, hearing the band music in
the distance, and suddenly, in the ruins of a village not
far from the city, I was overwhelmed by emotion, and
my eyes filled with tears; there in the ruins, the full
impact of the fact that I was walking the Strange Road to
Santiago finally hit me.
The view of the Pyrenees surrounding the valley, lit
by the morning sun and intensified by the sound of the
music, gave me the sensation that I was returning to
something primitive, something that had been forgotten
by most other human beings, something that I was
unable to identify. But it was a strange and powerful
feeling, and I decided to quicken my pace and arrive as
soon as possible at the place where Mme Lourdes had
said my guide would be waiting for me. Without stop-
22
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 22
ping, I took off my shirt and put it in my knapsack. The
straps cut into my bare shoulders a bit, but at least my
old sneakers were broken in enough that they caused
me no discomfort. After almost forty minutes, at a curve
in the road that circled around a gigantic rock, I came
upon an old abandoned well. There, sitting on the
ground, was a man of about fifty; he had black hair and
the look of a gypsy, and he was searching for something
in his knapsack.
‘Hola,’ I said in Spanish, with the same timidity that I
show whenever I meet someone new. ‘You must be
waiting for me. My name is Paulo.’
The man interrupted his search through the knapsack
and looked me up and down. His gaze was cold,
and he seemed not at all surprised by my arrival. I also
had the vague impression that I knew him.
‘Yes, I was waiting for you, but I didn’t know that I
was going to meet you so soon. What do you want?’
I was a little disconcerted by his question and
answered that it was I whom he was to guide along the
Milky Way in search of my sword.
‘That’s not necessary,’ said the man. ‘If you want me
to, I can find it for you. But you have to decide right
now whether you want me to.’
This conversation with the stranger seemed increasingly
weird to me. But since I had sworn complete
obedience, I tried to respond. If he could find my
sword for me, it would save an enormous amount of
time, and I could return immediately to my friends
23
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 23
and my business in Brazil; they were always on my
mind. This could also be a trick, but there was no
harm in giving him an answer.
As I was about to say yes, I heard a voice behind me
say, in heavily accented Spanish, ‘You don’t have to
climb a mountain to find out whether or not it’s high.’
It was the password! I turned and saw a man of
about forty, in khaki Bermudas and a white, sweaty Tshirt,
staring at the gypsy. He was gray-haired, and his
skin was darkened by the sun. In my haste, I had forgotten
the most elementary rules of self-protection and had
thrown myself body and soul into the arms of the first
stranger I had met.
‘The ship is safest when it’s in port, but that’s not
what ships were built for,’ I said, as the correct response.
Meanwhile, the man looked directly at the gypsy and
the gypsy stared at the man. Both confronted each
other, with no sign of fear or challenge, for some time.
Then the gypsy left the knapsack on the ground, smiled
disdainfully, and walked off in the direction of Saint-
Jean-Pied-de-Port.
‘My name is Petrus,’* said the new arrival as soon as
the gypsy had disappeared behind the huge stone that I
had circled a few minutes earlier. ‘Next time, be more
cautious.’
24
Paulo Coelho
* Actually, Petrus told me his real name. I have changed it in order
to protect his privacy, but this is one of the few times that names
have been changed in this book.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 24
I heard a sympathetic tone in his voice, it was different
from the tone of the gypsy and of Mme Lourdes. He
lifted the knapsack from the ground, and I noticed that
it had the scallop shell on its back. He produced a
bottle of wine, took a swallow, and offered it to me.
After I had taken a drink, I asked him who the gypsy
was.
‘This is a frontier route often used by smugglers and
terrorist refugees from the Spanish Basque country,’ said
Petrus. ‘The police hardly ever come near here.’
‘But you’re not answering me. You two looked at
each other like old acquaintances. And I had the feeling
that I knew him, too. That’s why I was so much at ease.’
Petrus smiled and said that we should move along. I
picked up my things, and we began to walk in silence.
From Petrus’s smile I knew that he was thinking the
same thing I was.
We had met with a devil.
We walked along without talking for a while, and I
could see that Mme Lourdes had been right; from
almost three kilometers away, we could still hear the
sound of the band. I wanted to ask some questions of
Petrus – about his life, his work, and what had brought
him here. I knew, though, that we still had seven hundred
kilometers to cover together and that the appropriate
moment would come for having all my questions
answered. But I could not get the gypsy out of my mind,
and finally I broke the silence.
‘Petrus, I think that the gypsy was the devil.’
25
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 25
‘Yes, he was the devil.’ When he confirmed this, I felt
a mixture of terror and relief. ‘But he isn’t the devil that
you know from the Tradition.’
In the Tradition, the devil is a spirit that is neither
good nor evil; he is considered to be the guardian of
most of the secrets that are accessible to human beings
and to have strength and power over material things.
Since he is a fallen angel, he is identified with the
human race, and he is always ready to make deals and
exchange favors. I asked what was the difference
between the gypsy and the devil of the Tradition.
‘We are going to meet others along the Road,’ he
smiled. ‘You will see for yourself. But just to give you an
idea, try to remember your entire conversation with the
gypsy.’
I reviewed the two phrases I had heard from him. He
had said that he was waiting for me and had affirmed
that he would seek out the sword for me.
Then Petrus said that those two phrases fit perfectly
well in the mouth of a thief who had been surprised in
the act of robbing a knapsack: they were aimed at gaining
time and at winning favor while he quickly figured
out a means of escape. On the other hand, the two
phrases could mean exactly what they said.
‘Which is right?’
‘Both are true. That poor thief, while he defended
himself, picked out of the air the very words that
needed to be said to you. He thought that he was being
intelligent, but he was really acting as the instrument of
26
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 26
a greater power. If he had fled when I arrived, we wouldn’t
be having this conversation now. But he confronted
me, and I read in his eyes the name of a devil that you
are going to meet somewhere along the Road.’
For Petrus, the meeting had been a favorable omen,
since the devil had revealed himself so early.
‘Meanwhile, don’t worry about him because, as I
have already told you, he won’t be the only one. He
may be the most important one, but he won’t be the
only one.’
We continued walking, passing from a desertlike
area to one where small trees were scattered here and
there. Once in a while Petrus broke the silence to tell me
some historic fact or other about the places we were
passing. I saw the house where a queen had spent the
last night of her life and a small chapel encrusted with
rocks, which had been the hermitage of a saintly man
who the few inhabitants of the area swore could perform
miracles.
‘Miracles are very important, don’t you think?’
Petrus said.
I agreed but said that I had never witnessed a great
miracle. My apprenticeship in the Tradition had been
much more on the intellectual plane. I believed that
when I recovered my sword, then, yes, I would be capable
of doing the great deeds that my Master did.
‘But what my Master performs are not miracles,
because they don’t contradict the laws of nature. What
my Master does is utilize these forces to …’
27
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 27
I couldn’t finish the sentence because I couldn’t
explain how my Master had been able to materialize
spirits, move objects from one place to another without
touching them, or, as I had witnessed more than once,
create patches of blue sky on a cloudy afternoon.
‘Maybe he does those things simply to convince you
that he has the knowledge and the power,’ answered
Petrus.
‘Yes, maybe so,’ I said, without much conviction.
We sat down on a stone because Petrus told me that
he hated to smoke cigarettes while he was walking.
According to him, the lungs absorbed much more nicotine
if one smoked while walking, and the smoke nauseated
him.
‘That was why the Master refused to let you have
the sword,’ Petrus continued. ‘Because you didn’t
understand why he performs his prodigious feats.
Because you forgot that the path to knowledge is a
path that’s open to everyone, to the common people.
During our journey, I’m going to teach you some exercises
and some rituals that are known as the practices
of RAM. All of us, at some time in our lives, have made
use of at least one of them. Every one of these practices,
without exception, can be discovered by anyone
who is willing to seek them out, with patience and
perspicacity, among the lessons that life itself teaches
us.
‘The RAM practices are so simple that people like
you, who are used to making life too complicated,
28
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 28
ascribe little value to them. But it is they that make
people capable of achieving anything, absolutely anything,
that they desire.
‘Jesus glorified the Father when his disciples began
to perform miracles and cures; he thanked God for
having kept such things secret from wise people and for
revealing them to simple folk. When all is said and
done, if we believe in God, we have to believe also that
God is just.’
Petrus was absolutely right. It would be a divine
injustice to allow only those people who were learned
and who had the time and money to buy expensive
books to have access to true knowledge.
‘The true path to wisdom can be identified by three
things,’ said Petrus. ‘First, it must involve agape, and I’ll
tell you more about this later; second, it has to have
practical application in your life. Otherwise, wisdom
becomes a useless thing and deteriorates, like a sword
that is never used.
‘And finally, it has to be a path that can be followed
by anyone. Like the road you are walking now, the Road
to Santiago.’
We walked for the rest of the afternoon, and only
when the sun began to disappear behind the mountains
did Petrus decide to stop again. All around us the highest
peaks of the Pyrenees still shone in the last light of
the day.
Petrus told me to clear a small area on the ground
and to kneel there.
29
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 29
‘The first RAM practice will help you to achieve
rebirth. You will have to do the exercise for seven consecutive
days, each time trying to experience in some
different way your first contact with the world. You
know how difficult it was for you to make the decision
to drop everything and come here to walk the Road to
Santiago in search of a sword. But this was difficult only
because you were a prisoner of the past. You had been
defeated before, and you were afraid that it could
happen again. You had already achieved things, and you
were afraid you might lose them. But at the same time,
something stronger than any of that prevailed: the
desire to find your sword. So you decided to take the
risk.’
I said that he was right but that I still had the worries
he described.
‘That doesn’t matter. The exercise, little by little, will
free you from the burdens that you have created in your
life.’
And Petrus taught me the first RAM practice: the
Seed Exercise.
‘Do it now for the first time,’ he said.
I lowered my head between my knees, breathed
deeply, and began to relax. My body obeyed without
question, perhaps because we had walked so far during
the day and I was exhausted. I began to listen to the
sound of the earth, muffled and harsh, and bit by bit I
transformed myself into a seed. I didn’t think.
Everything was dark, and I was asleep at the center of
30
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 30
the earth. Suddenly, something moved. It was a part of
me, a minuscule part of me that wanted to awaken, that
said that I had to leave this place because there was
something else ‘up there’. I wanted to sleep, but this part
insisted. I began to move my fingers, and my fingers
began to move my arms – but they were neither fingers
nor arms. They were a small shoot that was fighting to
overcome the force of the earth and to move in the
direction of that ‘something up there.’ I felt my body
begin to follow the movement of my arms. Each second
seemed like an eternity, but the seed needed to be born;
it needed to know what that ‘something up there’ was.
With immense difficulty, my head, then my body, began
to rise. Everything was too slow, and I had to fight
against the force that was pushing me down toward the
center of the earth where before I had been tranquil,
dreaming an eternal dream. But I was winning, I was
winning, and finally I broke through something and
was upright. The force that had been pressing down on
me suddenly ceased. I had broken through the earth
and was surrounded by that ‘something up there.’
The ‘something up there’ was the field. I sensed the
heat of the sun, the hum of the mosquitoes, the sound
of a river that ran in the distance. I arose slowly, with
my eyes closed, and felt that at any moment I was going
to become dizzy and fall to the ground. But meanwhile
I continued to grow. My arms were spreading and my
body stretching. There I was, being reborn, wanting to
be bathed both inside and out by the immense sun that

The Seed Exercise
Kneel on the ground. Then seat yourself on your
heels and bend forward so that your head touches
your knees. Stretch your arms behind you. You are
now in a fetal position. Relax, releasing all your
tensions. Breathe calmly and deeply. Little by little
you will perceive that you are a tiny seed, cradled in
the comfort of the earth. Everything around you is
warm and delicious. You are in a deep, restful sleep.
Suddenly, a finger moves. The shoot no longer
wants to be a seed; it wants to grow. Slowly you
begin to move your arms, and then your body will
begin to rise, straightening up until you are seated
on your heels. Now you begin to lift your body up,
and slowly, slowly you will become erect, still
kneeling on the ground.
The moment has come to break completely
through the earth. You begin to rise slowly, placing
one foot on the ground, then the other, fighting
against the disequilibrium just as a shoot battles to
make its own space, until finally you are standing.
Imagine the area about you, the sun, the water, the
wind, and the birds. Now you are a shoot that is
beginning to grow. Slowly raise your arms toward
the sky. Then stretch yourself more and more, more
and more, as if you want to grasp the enormous sun
that shines above you. Your body begins to become
more and more rigid, all of your muscles strain, and
32

you feel yourself to be growing, growing, growing –
you become huge. The tension increases more and
more until it becomes painful, unbearable. When
you can no longer stand it, scream and open your
eyes.
Repeat this exercise for seven consecutive days,
always at the same time.

was shining and that was asking me to continue to grow
more, stretch more, and embrace it with all of my
branches. I was stretching my arms more and more, and
the muscles throughout my body began to hurt. I felt
that I was a thousand meters tall and that I could
embrace mountains. And my body was expanding,
expanding until the pain in my muscles became so
intense that I couldn’t bear it, and I screamed.
I opened my eyes, and Petrus was there in front of
me, smiling and smoking a cigarette. The light of day
had not yet disappeared, but I was surprised to see that
the sun was not as bright as I had imagined. I asked if
he wanted me to describe the sensations, and he said
no.
‘This is a very personal thing, and you should keep it
to yourself. How can I judge it? The sensations are
yours, not mine.’
Petrus said that we were going to sleep right there.
We built a small fire, drank what was left of his wine,
and I made some sandwiches with a foie gras that I had
bought before I reached Saint-Jean. Petrus went to the
stream that ran nearby and caught some fish, which he
fried over the fire. And then we crawled into our sleeping
bags.
Among the greatest sensations that I have experienced
in my life were those I felt on that unforgettable
first night on the Road to Santiago. It was cold, despite
its being summer, but I could still taste the warmth of
the wine that Petrus had brought. I looked up at the sky;
34
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 34
the Milky Way spread across it, reflecting the immensity
of the Road we would have to travel. This immensity
made me very anxious; it created a terrible fear that I
would not be able to succeed – that I was too small for
this task. Yet today I had been a seed and had been
reborn. I had discovered that although the earth and my
sleep were full of comfort, the life ‘up there’ was much
more beautiful. And I could always be reborn, as many
times as I wanted, until my arms were long enough to
embrace the earth from which I had come.

The Creator and the Created
For seven days we continued walking through the
Pyrenees, climbing and descending the mountains, and
each evening, as the rays of the sun reflected from the
tallest peaks, Petrus had me perform the Seed Exercise.
On the third day of our trek, we passed a cement
marker, painted yellow, indicating that we had crossed
the frontier; from then on we would be walking through
Spain. Little by little, Petrus began to reveal some things
about his private life; I learned that he was Italian and
that he worked in industrial design.*
I asked him whether he was worried about the many
things he had been forced to abandon in order to guide
a pilgrim in search of his sword.
37
* It has been said that there is no such thing as coincidence in this
world, and the following story confirms the truth of this assertion
once again. One afternoon, I was leafing through some
magazines in the lobby of the hotel where I was staying in
Madrid, when I noticed a piece about the Prince of Asturias Prize;
a Brazilian journalist, Robert Marinho, had been one of the prize
winners. A closer study of the photograph of those at the awards
dinner startled me, though. At one of the tables, elegantly dressed
in his tuxedo, was Petrus, described in the caption as ‘one of the
most famous European designers of the moment.’
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 37
‘Let me explain something to you,’ he answered. ‘I
am not guiding you to your sword. It is your job, solely
and exclusively, to find it. I am here to lead you along
the Road to Santiago and to teach you the RAM practices.
How you apply this to your search for your sword
is your problem.’
‘But you didn’t answer my question.’
‘When you travel, you experience, in a very practical
way, the act of rebirth. You confront completely new situations,
the day passes more slowly, and on most journeys
you don’t even understand the language the people speak.
So you are like a child just out of the womb. You begin to
be more accessible to others because they may be able to
help you in difficult situations. And you accept any small
favor from the gods with great delight, as if it were an
episode you would remember for the rest of your life.
‘At the same time, since all things are new, you see
only the beauty in them, and you feel happy to be alive.
That’s why a religious pilgrimage has always been one of
the most objective ways of achieving insight. The word
peccadillo, which means a “small sin,” comes from pecus,
which means “defective foot,” a foot that is incapable of
walking a road. The way to correct the peccadillo is
always to walk forward, adapting oneself to new situations
and receiving in return all of the thousands of blessings
that life generously offers to those who seek them.
‘So why would you think that I might be worried
about a half-dozen projects that I left behind in order to
be here with you?’
38
Paulo Coelho

Petrus looked around him, and I followed his eyes.
On the uplands of one of the peaks, some goats were
grazing. One of them, more daring than the others,
stood on an outcropping of a high boulder, and I could
not figure out how he had reached that spot or how he
would get down. But as I was thinking this, the goat
leapt and, alighting in a place I couldn’t even see,
rejoined his companions. Everything in our surrounds
reflected an uneasy peace, the peace of a world that was
still in the process of growing and being created – a
world that seemed to know that, in order to grow, it had
to continue moving along, always moving along. Great
earthquakes and killer storms might make nature seem
cruel, but I could see that these were just the vicissitudes
of being on the road. Nature itself journeyed, seeking
illumination.
‘I am very glad to be here,’ said Petrus, ‘because the
work I did not finish is not important and the work I
will be able to do after I get back will be so much better.’
When I had read the works of Carlos Castaneda, I
had wanted very much to meet the old medicine man,
Don Juan. Watching Petrus look at the mountain, I felt
that I was with someone very much like him.
On the afternoon of the seventh day, after having
passed through some pine woods, we reached the top
of a mountain. There, Charlemagne had said his
prayers for the first time on Spanish soil, and now an
ancient monument urged in Latin that all who passed
by should say a Salve Regina. We both did as the
39
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 39
monument asked. Then Petrus had me do the Seed
Exercise for the last time.
There was a strong wind, and it was cold, I argued
that it was still early – at the latest, it was only three in
the afternoon – but he told me not to talk about it, just
do exactly as he ordered.
I knelt on the ground and began to perform the
exercise. Everything went as usual until the moment
when I extended my arms and began to imagine the
sun. When I reached that point, with the gigantic sun
shining there in front of me, I felt myself entering into a
state of ecstasy. My memories of human life began
slowly to dim, and I was no longer doing an exercise: I
had become a tree. I was happy about this. The sun
shone and revolved, which had never happened before.
I remained there, my branches extended, my leaves
trembling in the wind, not wanting ever to change my
position – until something touched me, and everything
went dark for a fraction of a second.
I immediately opened my eyes. Petrus had slapped
me across the face and was holding me by the shoulders.
‘Don’t lose sight of your objective!’ he said, enraged.
‘Don’t forget that you still have a great deal to learn
before you find your sword!’
I sat down on the ground, shivering in the cold wind.
‘Does that always happen?’ I asked.
‘Almost always,’ he said. ‘Mainly with people like
you, who are fascinated by details and forget what they
are after.’

The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 40
Petrus took a sweater from his knapsack and put it
on. I put my overshirt on, covering my ‘I LOVE NY’ Tshirt.
I would never have imagined that in the ‘hottest
summer of the decade,’ according to the newspapers, it
could be so cold. The two shirts helped to cut the wind,
but I asked Petrus if we couldn’t move along more
quickly so that I could warm up.
The Road now made for an easy descent. I thought
that the extreme cold I had experienced was due to the
fact that we had eaten very frugally, just fish and the
fruits of the forest.*
Petrus said that it wasn’t the lack of food and
explained that it was cold because we had reached the
highest point in the range of mountains.
We had not gone more than five hundred meters
when, at a curve in the Road, the scene changed completely.
A tremendous, rolling plain extended into the
distance. And to the left, on the Road down, less than
two hundred meters away, a beautiful little village
awaited us with its chimneys smoking.
I began to walk faster, but Petrus held me back.
‘I think that this is a good time to teach you the
second RAM practice,’ he said, sitting down on the
ground and indicating that I should do the same.
I was irritated, but I did as he asked. The sight of the
41
The Pilgrimage
* There is a red fruit whose name I do not know, but just the sight
of it today makes me nauseated from having eaten so much of it
while walking through the Pyrenees.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 41
small village with its inviting chimney smoke had really
upset me. Suddenly I realized that we had been out in
the woods for a week; we had seen no one and had been
either sleeping on the ground or walking throughout the
day. I had run out of cigarettes, so I had been smoking
the horrible roller tobacco that Petrus used. Sleeping in a
sleeping bag and eating unseasoned fish were things that
I had loved when I was twenty, but here on the Road to
Santiago, they were sacrifices. I waited impatiently for
Petrus to finish rolling his cigarette, while I thought
about the warmth of a glass of wine in the bar I could
see less than five minutes down the Road.
Petrus, bundled up in his sweater, was relaxed and
looked out over the immense plain.
‘What do you think about this crossing of the
Pyrenees?’ he asked, after a while.
‘Very nice,’ I answered, not wanting to prolong the
conversation.
‘It must have been nice, because it took us six days to
go a distance we could have gone in one’.
I could not believe what he was saying. He pulled
out the map and showed me the distance: seventeen
kilometers. Even walking at a slow pace because of the
ups and downs, the Road could have been hiked in six
hours.
‘You are so concerned about finding your sword that
you forgot the most important thing: you have to get
there. Looking only for Santiago – which you can’t see
from here, in any case – you didn’t see that we passed
42
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 42
by certain places four or five times, approaching them
from different angles.’
Now that Petrus mentioned it, I began to realize that
Mount Itchasheguy – the highest peak in the region –
had sometimes been to my right and sometimes to my
left. Although I had noticed this, I had not drawn the
only possible conclusion: that we had gone back and
forth many times.
‘All I did was to follow different routes, using the
paths made through the woods by the smugglers. But it
was your responsibility to have seen that. This happened
because the process of moving along did not
exist for you. The only thing that existed was your desire
to arrive at your goal.’
‘Well, what if I had noticed?’
‘We would have taken seven days anyway, because
that is what the RAM practices call for. But at least you
would have approached the Pyrenees in a different way.’
I was so surprised that I forgot about the village and
the temperature.
‘When you are moving toward an objective,’ said
Petrus, ‘It is very important to pay attention to the road.
It is the road that teaches us the best way to get there,
and the road enriches us as we walk its length. You can
compare it to a sexual relationship: the caresses of foreplay
determine the intensity of the orgasm. Everyone
knows that.
‘And it is the same thing when you have an objective
in your life. It will turn out to be better or worse
43
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 43
depending on the route you choose to reach it and the
way you negotiate that route. That’s why the second
RAM practice is so important; it extracts from what we
are used to seeing every day the secrets that because of
our routine, we never see.’
And then Petrus taught me the Speed Exercise.
‘In the city, amid all the things we have to do every
day, the exercise should be done for twenty minutes.
But since we are on the Strange Road to Santiago, we
should wait an hour before getting to the village.’
The cold – about which I had already forgotten –
returned, and I looked at Petrus with desperation. But
he paid no attention; he got up, grabbed his knapsack,
and began to walk the two hundred meters to the village
with an exasperating slowness. At first, I looked
only in the direction of the tavern, a small, ancient, twostory
building with a wooden sign hanging above the
door. We were so close that I could even read the year
when the tavern had been built: 1652. We were moving,
but it seemed as if we had not left our original spot.
Petrus placed one foot in front of the other very slowly,
and I did the same. I took my watch from my knapsack
and strapped it to my wrist.
‘It’s going to be worse that way,’ he said, ‘because
time isn’t something that always proceeds at the same
pace. It is we who determine how quickly time passes.’
I began to look at my watch every minute and found
that he was right. The more I looked at it, the more
slowly the minutes passed. I decided to take his advice,
44

45
The Pilgrimage
The Speed Exercise
Walk for twenty minutes at half the speed at which
you normally walk. Pay attention to the details,
people, and surroundings. The best time to do this
is after lunch.
Repeat the exercise for seven days.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 45
and I put the watch back in my knapsack. I tried to pay
more attention to the Road, the plain, and the stones I
stepped on, but I kept looking ahead to the tavern – and
I was convinced that we hadn’t moved at all. I thought
about telling myself some stories, but the exercise was
making me anxious, and I couldn’t concentrate. When I
couldn’t resist any longer and took my watch out again,
only eleven minutes had passed.
‘Don’t make a torture out of this exercise, because it
wasn’t meant to be like that,’ said Petrus. ‘Try to find
pleasure in a speed that you’re not used to. Changing
the way you do routine things allows a new person to
grow inside of you. But when all is said and done,
you’re the one who must decide how you handle it.’
The kindness expressed in his final phrase calmed
me down a bit. If it was I who decided what I would
do, then it was better to take advantage of the situation.
I breathed deeply and tried not to think. I put
myself into a strange state, one in which time was
something distant and of no interest to me. I calmed
myself more and more and began to perceive the
things that surrounded me through new eyes. My
imagination, which was unavailable when I was tense,
began to work to my advantage. I looked at the small
village there in front of me and began to create a story
about it; the delight in finding people and lodging
after the cold wind of the Pyrenees. At one point, I
sensed that there was in the village a strong, mysterious,
and all-knowing presence. My imagination
46
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 46
peopled the plain with knights and battles. I could see
their swords shining in the sun and hear the cries of
war. The village was no longer just a place where I
could warm my soul with wine and my body with a
blanket; it was a historic monument, the work of
heroic people who had left everything behind to
become a part of that solitary place. The world was
there around me, and I realized that seldom had I paid
attention to it.
When I regained my everyday awareness, we were at
the door of the tavern, and Petrus was inviting me to
enter.
‘I’ll buy the wine,’ he said. ‘And let’s get to sleep
early, because tomorrow I have to introduce you to a
great sorcerer.’
Mine was a deep and dreamless sleep. As soon as
daylight began to show itself in the two streets of the
village of Roncesvalles, Petrus knocked on my door. We
were in rooms on the top floor of the tavern, which also
served as a hotel.
We had some coffee and some bread with olive oil,
and we left, plodding through the dense fog that had
fallen over the area. I could see that Roncesvalles wasn’t
exactly a village, as I had thought at first. At the time of
the great pilgrimages along the Road, it had been the
most powerful monastery in the region, with direct
influence over the territory that extended all the way to
the Navarra border. And it still retained some of its
original character: its few buildings had been part of a
47
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 47
religious brotherhood. The only construction that had
any lay characteristics was the tavern where we had
stayed.
We walked through the fog to the Collegiate Church.
Inside, garbed in white, several monks were saying the
first morning mass in unison. I couldn’t understand a
word they were saying, since the mass was being celebrated
in Basque. Petrus sat in one of the pews to the
side and indicated that I should join him.
The Church was enormous and filled with art
objects of incalculable value. Petrus explained to me in
a whisper that it had been built through donations
from the kings and queens of Portugal, Spain, France,
and Germany, on a site selected by the emperor
Charlemagne. On the high altar, the Virgin of
Roncesvalles – sculpted in massive silver, with a face of
precious stone – held in her hands a branch of flowers
made of jewels. The smell of incense, the Gothic construction,
and the chanting monks in white began to
induce in me a state similar to the trances I had experienced
during the rituals of Tradition.
‘And the sorcerer?’ I asked, remembering what he
had said on the previous afternoon.
Petrus indicated with a nod of his head a monk who
was middle-aged, thin, and bespectacled, sitting with
the other brothers on the narrow benches beside the
high altar. A sorcerer, and at the same time a monk! I
was eager for the mass to be over, but as Petrus had said
to me the day before, it is we who determine the pace of
48
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 48
time: my anxiety caused the religious ceremony to last
for more than an hour.
When the mass was over, Petrus left me alone in the
pew and went out through the door that the monks had
used as an exit. I remained there for a while, gazing
about the church and feeling that I should offer some
kind of prayer, but I wasn’t able to concentrate. The
images appeared to be in the distance, locked in a past
that would never return, like the Golden Age of the
Road to Santiago.
Petrus appeared in the doorway and, without a
word, signalled that I should follow him.
We came to an inside garden of the monastery, surrounded
by a stone veranda. At the center of the garden
there was a fountain, and seated at its edge, waiting for
us, was the bespectacled monk.
‘Father Jordi, this is the pilgrim,’ said Petrus, introducing
me.
The monk held out his hand, and I shook it. No one
said anything else. I was waiting for something to
happen, but I heard only the crowing of roosters in the
distance and the cries of the hawks taking off for their
daily hunt. The monk looked at me expressionlessly, in
a way that reminded me of Mme Lourdes’s manner after
I had spoken the Ancient Word.
Finally, after a long and uncomfortable silence,
Father Jordi spoke.
‘It looks to me like you rose through the levels of the
Tradition a bit early, my friend.’
49
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 49
I answered that I was thirty-eight and had been quite
successful in all the trials.*
‘Except for one, the last and most important,’ he
said, continuing to look at me without expression. ‘And
without that one, nothing you have learned has any significance.’
‘That is why I am walking the Road to Santiago.’
‘Which guarantees nothing. Come with me.’
Petrus stayed in the garden, and I followed Father
Jordi. We crossed the cloisters, passed the place where a
king was buried – Sancho the Strong – and went to a
small chapel set among the group of main buildings
that made up the monastery of Roncesvalles.
There was almost nothing inside: only a table, a
book, and a sword – a sword that wasn’t mine.
Father Jordi sat at the table, leaving me standing. He
took some herbs and lit them, filling the place with
their perfume. More and more, the situation reminded
me of my encounter with Mme Lourdes.
‘First, I want to tell you something,’ said Father Jordi.
‘The Jacobean route is only one of four roads. It is the
Road of the Spades, and it may give you power, but that
is not enough.’
‘What are the other three?’
50
Paulo Coelho
* Trials are ritual tests in which importance is given not only to the
disciple’s dedication but also to the auguries that emerge during
their execution. This usage of the term originated during the
Inquisition.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 50
‘You know at least two others: the Road to Jerusalem,
which is the Road of the Hearts, or of the Grail, and
which endows you with the ability to perform miracles;
and the Road to Rome, which is the Road of the Clubs; it
allows you to communicate with other worlds.’
‘So what’s missing is the Road of the Diamonds to
complete the four suits of the deck,’ I joked. And the
father laughed.
‘Exactly. That’s the secret Road. If you take it someday,
you won’t be helped by anybody. For now, let us
leave that one aside. Where are your scallop shells?’
I opened my knapsack and took out the shells on
which stood the image of Our Lady of the Visitation. He
put the figure on the table. He held his hands over it
and began to concentrate. He told me to do the same.
The perfume in the air was growing stronger. Both the
monk and I had our eyes open, and suddenly I could
sense that the same phenomenon was occurring as had
taken place at Itatiaia: the shells glowed with a light that
did not illuminate. The brightness grew and grew, and I
heard a mysterious voice, emanating from Father Jordi’s
throat, saying, ‘Wherever your treasure is, there will be
your heart.’
It was a phrase from the Bible. But the voice continued,
‘And wherever your heart is, there will be the cradle
of the Second Coming of Christ; like these shells, the
pilgrim is only an outer layer. When that layer, which is
a stratum of life, is broken, life appears, and that life is
comprised of agape.’
51
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 51
He drew back his hands, and the shells lost their
glow. Then he wrote my name in the book that was on
the table. Along the Road to Santiago, I saw only three
books where my name was written: Mme Lourdes’s,
Father Jordi’s, and the Book of Power, where later I was
to write my own name.
‘That’s all,’ he said. ‘You can go with the blessing of
the Virgin of Roncesvalles and of San Tiago of the
Sword.
‘The Jacobean route is marked with yellow pointers,
painted all the way across Spain,’ said the monk, as we
returned to the place where Petrus was waiting. ‘If you
should lose your way at any time, look for the markers –
on trees, on stones, and on traffic signs – and you will
be able to find a safe place.’
‘I have a good guide.’
‘But try to depend mainly on yourself – so that you
aren’t coming and going for six days in the Pyrenees.’
So the monk already knew the story.
We found Petrus and then said good-bye. As we left
Roncesvalles that morning, the fog had disappeared
completely. A straight, flat road extended in front of
us, and I began to see the yellow markers Father Jordi
had mentioned. The knapsack was a bit heavier,
because I had bought a bottle of wine at the tavern,
despite the fact that Petrus had told me that it was
unnecessary. After Roncesvalles, hundreds of small villages
dotted the route, and I was to sleep outdoors very
seldom.

‘Petrus, Father Jordi spoke about the Second Coming
of Christ as if it were something that were happening
now.’
‘It is always happening. That is the secret of your
sword.’
‘And you told me that I was going to meet with a
sorcerer, but I met with a monk. What does magic have
to do with the Catholic Church?’
Petrus said just one word:
‘Everything.’

Cruelty
‘Right there. That’s the exact spot where love was murdered,’
said the old man, pointing to a small church
built into the rocks.
We had walked for five days in a row, stopping only
to eat and sleep. Petrus continued to be guarded about
his private life but asked many questions about Brazil
and about my work. He said that he really liked my
country, because the image he knew best was that of
Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado, standing open
armed rather than suffering on the cross. He wanted to
know everything, and he especially wanted to know if
the women were as pretty as the ones here in Spain. The
heat of the day was almost unbearable, and in all of the
bars and villages where we stopped, the people complained
about the drought. Because of the heat, we
adopted the Spanish custom of the siesta and rested
between two and four in the afternoon when the sun
was at its hottest.
That afternoon, as we sat in an olive grove, the old
man had come up to us and offered us a taste of wine.
In spite of the heat, the habit of drinking wine had been
part of life in that region for centuries.
55
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 55
‘What do you mean, love was murdered there?’ I
asked, since the old man seemed to want to strike up a
conversation.
‘Many centuries ago, a princess who was walking the
Road to Santiago, Felicia of Aquitaine, decided, on her
way back to Compostela, to give up everything and live
here. She was love itself, because she divided all of her
wealth among the poor people of the region and began
to care for the sick.’
Petrus had lit one of his horrible rolled cigarettes,
but despite his air of indifference, I could see that he
was listening carefully to the old man’s story.
‘Her brother, Duke Guillermo, was sent by their
father to bring her home. But Felicia refused to go. In
desperation, the duke fatally stabbed her there in that
small church that you can see in the distance; she had
built it with her own hands in order to care for the poor
and offer praise to God.
‘When he came to his senses and realized what he
had done, the duke went to Rome to ask the pope’s forgiveness.
As penitence, the pope ordered him to walk to
Compostela. Then a curious thing happened: on his
way back, when he arrived here, he had the same
impulse as his sister, and he stayed on, living in that
little church that his sister had built, caring for the poor
until the last days of his long life.’
‘That’s the law of retribution at work,’ Petrus laughed.
The old man did not understand, but I knew what Petrus
was saying. His concept of the law of retribution was
56
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 56
similar to that of karma, or of the concept that as one
sows, so shall they reap.
As we had been walking, we had gotten involved in
some long theological discussions about the relationship
between God and humanity. I had argued that in the
Tradition, there was always an involvement with God,
but that it was a complex one. The path to God, for me,
was quite different from the one we were following on
the Road to Santiago, with its priests who were sorcerers,
its gypsies who were devils, and its saints who performed
miracles. All of these things seemed to me to be primitive,
and too much connected with Christianity; they
lacked the fascination, the elegance, and the ecstasy that
the rituals of the Tradition evoked in me. Petrus on the
other hand, argued that the guiding concept along the
Road to Santiago was its simplicity. That the Road was
one along which any person could walk, that its significance
could be understood by even the least sophisticated
person, and that, in fact, only such a road as that
could lead to God. So Petrus thought my relationship to
God was based too much on concept, on intellect, and on
reasoning; I felt that his was too simplistic and intuitive.
‘You believe that God exists, and so do I,’ Petrus had
said at one point. ‘So God exists for both of us. But if
someone doesn’t believe in him, that doesn’t mean God
ceases to exist. Nor does it mean that the nonbeliever is
wrong.’
‘Does that mean that the existence of God depends
on a person’s desire and power?’

‘I had a friend once who was drunk all the time but
who said three Hail Marys every night. His mother had
conditioned him to do so ever since he was a child.
Even when he came home helplessly drunk, and even
though he did not believe in God, my friend always said
his three Hail Marys. After he died, I was at a ritual of
the Tradition, and I asked the spirit of the ancients
where my friend was. The spirit answered that he was
fine and that he was surrounded by light. Without ever
having had the faith during his life, the three prayers he
had said ritualistically every day had brought him salvation.
‘God was manifest in the caves and in the thunderstorms
of prehistory. After people began to see God’s
hand in the caves and thunderstorms, they began to see
him in the animals and in special places in the forest.
During certain difficult times, God existed only in the
catacombs of the great cities. But through all of time, he
never ceased to live in the human heart in the form of
love.
‘In recent times, some thought that God was merely
a concept, subject to scientific proof. But, at this point,
history has been reversed, or rather is starting all over
again. Faith and love have resumed their importance.
When Father Jordi cited that quotation from Jesus,
saying that wherever your treasure is, there also would
your heart be, he was referring to the importance of love
and good works. Wherever it is that you want to see the
face of God, there you will see it. And if you don’t want
58
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 58
to see it, that doesn’t matter, so long as you are performing
good works. When Felicia of Aquitaine built her
small church and began to help the poor, she forgot
about the God of the Vatican. She became God’s manifestation
by becoming wiser and by living a simpler life
– in other words, through love. It is in that respect that
the old man was absolutely right in saying that love had
been murdered.’
Now Petrus said, ‘The law of retribution was operating
when Felicia’s brother felt forced to continue the
good works he had interrupted. Anything is permissible
but the interruption of a manifestation of love. When
that happens, whoever tried to destroy it is responsible
for its recreation.’
I explained that in my country the law of return said
that people’s deformities and diseases were punishments
for mistakes committed in previous incarnations.
‘Nonsense,’ said Petrus. ‘God is not vengeance, God
is love. His only form of punishment is to make someone
who interrupts a work of love continue it.’
The old man excused himself, saying that it was late
and that he had to get back to work. Petrus thought it
was a good time for us to get up, too, and get back on
the Road.
‘Let’s forget all of our discussion about God,’ he said,
as we made our way through the olive trees. ‘God is in
everything around us. He has to be felt and lived. And
here I am trying to transform him into a problem in
logic so that you can understand him. Keep doing the
59
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 59
exercise of walking slowly, and you will learn more and
more about his presence.’
Two days later, we had to climb a mountain called
the Peak of Forgiveness. The climb took several hours,
and at the top, I was shocked to find a group of tourists
sunbathing and drinking beer; their car radios blasted
music at top volume. They had driven up a nearby road
to get to the top of the mountain.
‘That’s the way it is,’ said Petrus. ‘Did you expect that
you were going to find one of El Cid’s warriors up here,
watching for the next Moorish attack?’
As we descended, I performed the Speed Exercise for
the last time. Before us was another immense plain with
sparse vegetation burned by the drought; it was bordered
by blue mountains. There were almost no trees,
only the rocky ground and some cactus. At the end of
the exercise, Petrus asked me about my work, and it was
only then that I realized that I hadn’t thought about it
for some time. My worries about business and about the
things I had left undone had practically disappeared.
Now I thought of these things only at night, and even
then I didn’t give them much importance. I was happy
to be there, walking the Road to Santiago.
I told Petrus how I was feeling, and he joked, ‘Any
time now you are going to do the same thing as Felicia
of Aquitaine.’ Then he stopped and asked me to put my
knapsack on the ground.
‘Look around you, and choose some point to fixate
on,’ he said.
60
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 60
I chose the cross on a church that I could see in the
distance.
‘Keep your eyes fixed on that point, and try to concentrate
only on what I am going to tell you. Even if you
feel something different, don’t become distracted. Do as
I am telling you.’
I stood there, relaxed, with my eyes fixed on the
cross, as Petrus took a position behind me and pressed a
finger into the base of my neck.
‘The Road you are traveling is the Road of power, and
only the exercises having to do with power will be taught
to you. The journey, which prior to this was torture
because all you wanted to do was get there, is now beginning
to become a pleasure. It is the pleasure of searching
and the pleasure of an adventure. You are nourishing
something that’s very important – your dreams.
‘We must never stop dreaming. Dreams provide
nourishment for the soul, just as a meal does for the
body. Many times in our lives we see our dreams shattered
and our desires frustrated, but we have to continue
dreaming. If we don’t, our soul dies, and agape cannot
reach it. A lot of blood has been shed in those fields out
there; some of the cruelest battles of Spain’s war to
expel the Moors were fought on them. Who was in the
right or who knew the truth does not matter; what’s
important is knowing that both sides were fighting the
good fight.
‘The good fight is the one we fight because our heart
asks it of us. In the heroic ages – at the time of the
61
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 61
knights in armor – this was easy. There were lands to
conquer and much to do. Today, though, the world has
changed a lot, and the good fight has shifted from the
battlefields to the fields within ourselves.
‘The good fight is the one that’s fought in the
name of our dreams. When we’re young and our
dreams first explode inside us with all of their force,
we are very courageous, but we haven’t yet learned
how to fight. With great effort, we learn how to fight,
but by then we no longer have the courage to go into
combat. So we turn against ourselves and do battle
within. We become our own worst enemy. We say that
our dreams were childish, or too difficult to realize, or
the result of our not having known enough about life.
We kill our dreams because we are afraid to fight the
good fight.’
The pressure of Petrus’s finger on my neck became
stronger. I perceived that the cross on the church had
been transformed; now its outline seemed to be that of
a winged being, an angel. I blinked my eyes, and the
cross became a cross again.
‘The first symptom of the process of our killing our
dreams is the lack of time,’ Petrus continued. ‘The
busiest people I have known in my life always have time
enough to do everything. Those who do nothing are
always tired and pay no attention to the little amount of
work they are required to do. They complain constantly
that the day is too short. The truth is, they are afraid to
fight the good fight.
62
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 62
‘The second symptom of the death of our dreams
lies in our certainties. Because we don’t want to see life
as a grand adventure, we begin to think of ourselves as
wise and fair and correct in asking so little of life. We
look beyond the walls of our day-to-day existence, and
we hear the sound of lances breaking, we smell the dust
and the sweat, and we see the great defeats and the fire
in the eyes of the warriors. But we never see the delight,
the immense delight in the hearts of those who are
engaged in the battle. For them, neither victory nor
defeat is important; what’s important is only that they
are fighting the good fight.
‘And, finally, the third symptom of the passing of
our dreams is peace. Life becomes a Sunday afternoon;
we ask for nothing grand, and we cease to demand anything
more than we are willing to give. In that state, we
think of ourselves as being mature; we put aside the fantasies
of our youth, and we seek personal and professional
achievement. We are surprised when people our
age say that they still want this or that out of life. But
really, deep in our hearts, we know that what has happened
is that we have renounced the battle for our
dreams – we have refused to fight the good fight.’
The tower of the church kept changing; now it
appeared to be an angel with its wings spread. The more
I blinked, the longer the figure remained. I wanted to
speak to Petrus but I sensed that he hadn’t finished.
‘When we renounce our dreams and find peace,’
he said after a while, ‘we go through a short period of
63
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 63
tranquillity. But the dead dreams begin to rot within us
and to infect our entire being. We become cruel to those
around us, and then we begin to direct this cruelty
against ourselves. That’s when illnesses and psychoses
arise. What we sought to avoid in combat – disappointment
and defeat – come upon us because of our cowardice.
And one day, the dead, spoiled dreams make it
difficult to breathe, and we actually seek death. It’s
death that frees us from our certainties, from our work,
and from that terrible peace of our Sunday afternoons.’
Now I was sure that I was really seeing an angel, and
I couldn’t pay attention to what Petrus was saying. He
must have sensed this, because he removed his finger
from my neck and stopped talking. The image of the
angel remained for a few moments and then disappeared.
In its place, the tower of the church returned.
We were silent for a few minutes. Petrus rolled himself
a cigarette and began to smoke. I took the bottle of
wine from my knapsack and had a swallow. It was
warm, but it was still delicious.
‘What did you see?’ he asked me.
I told him about the angel. I said that at the beginning,
the image would disappear when I blinked.
‘You, too, have to learn how to fight the good fight.
You have already learned to accept the adventures and
challenges that life provides, but you still want to deny
anything that is extraordinary.’
Petrus took a small object from his knapsack and
handed it to me. It was a golden pin.
64
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 64
‘This was a present from my grandmother. In the
Order of the RAM, all of the ancients have an object
such as this. It’s called “the Point of Cruelty.” When you
saw the angel appear on the church tower, you wanted
to deny it, because it wasn’t something that you are
used to. In your view of the world, churches are
churches, and visions occur only during the ecstasy created
by the rituals of the Tradition.’
I said that my vision must have been caused by the
pressure he was applying to my neck.
‘That’s right, but that doesn’t change anything. The
fact is that you rejected the vision. Felicia of Aquitaine
must have seen something similar, and she bet her
entire life on what she saw. And the result of her having
done that transformed her work into a work of love.
The same thing probably happened to her brother. And
the same thing happens to everyone every day: we
always know which is the best road to follow, but we
follow only the road that we have become accustomed
to.’
Petrus began to walk again, and I followed along.
The rays of the sun made the pin in my hand glisten.
‘The only way we can rescue our dreams is by being
generous with ourselves. Any attempt to inflict selfpunishment
– no matter how subtle it may be – should
be dealt with rigorously. In order to know when we are
being cruel to ourselves, we have to transform any
attempt at causing spiritual pain – such as guilt,
remorse, indecision, and cowardice – into physical pain.
65
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 65
By transforming a spiritual pain into a physical one, we
can learn what harm it can cause us.’
And then Petrus taught me the Cruelty Exercise.
‘In ancient times, they used a golden pin for this,’ he
said. ‘Nowadays, things have changed, just as the sights
along the Road to Santiago change.’
Petrus was right. Seen from down at this level, the
plain appeared to be a series of mountains in front of me.
‘Think of something cruel that you did to yourself
today, and perform the exercise.’
I couldn’t think of anything.
‘That’s the way it always is. We are only able to be
kind to ourselves at the few times when we need severity.’
Suddenly I remembered that I had called myself an
idiot for having laboriously climbed the Peak of
Forgiveness while the tourists had driven up in their
cars. I knew that this was unfair and that I had been
cruel to myself; the tourists, after all, were only looking
for a place to sunbathe, while I was looking for my
sword. I wasn’t an idiot, even if I had felt like one. I dug
the nail of my index finger forcefully into the cuticle of
my thumb. I felt intense pain, and as I concentrated on
it, the feeling of having been an idiot dissipated.
I described this to Petrus, and he laughed without
saying anything.
That night, we stayed in a comfortable hotel in the
village where the church I had focused on was located.
After dinner, we decided to take a walk through the
streets, as an aid to digestion.
66

67
The Pilgrimage
The Cruelty Exercise
Every time a thought comes to mind that makes
you feel bad about yourself – jealousy, self pity,
envy, hatred, and so on – do the following:
Dig the nail of your index finger into the cuticle of
the thumb of the same hand until it becomes quite
painful. Concentrate on the pain: it is a physical
reflection of the suffering you are going through
spiritually. Ease the pressure only when the cruel
thought has gone.
Repeat this as many times as necessary until the
thought has left you, even if this means digging
your fingernail into your thumb over and over. Each
time, it will take longer for the cruel thought to
return, and eventually it will disappear altogether,
so long as you do not fail to perform the exercise
every time it comes to mind.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 67
‘Of all the ways we have found to hurt ourselves, the
worst has been through love. We are always suffering
because of someone who doesn’t love us, or someone
who has left us, or someone who won’t leave us. If we
are alone, it is because no one wants us; if we are married,
we transform the marriage to slavery. What a terrible
thing!’ he said angrily.
We came to a square, and there was the church I had
seen. It was small and lacked any architectural distinction.
Its bell tower reached up toward the sky. I tried to
see the angel again, but couldn’t.
‘When the Son of God descended to earth, he
brought love to us. But since people identified love only
with suffering and sacrifice, they felt they had to crucify
Jesus. Had they not done so, no one would have
believed in the love that Jesus brought, since people
were so used to suffering every day with their own problems.’
We sat on the curb and stared at the church. Once
again, it was Petrus who broke the silence.
‘Do you know what Barrabas means, Paulo? Bar
means son, and abba means father.’
He gazed at the cross on the bell tower. His eyes
shone, and I sensed that he was moved by something –
perhaps by the love he had spoken so much about, but I
couldn’t be certain.
‘The intentions of the divine glory were so wise!’ he
said, his voice echoing in the empty square. ‘When
Pontius Pilate made the people choose, he actually gave
68
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 68
them no choice at all. He presented them with one man
who had been whipped and was falling apart, and he
presented them with another man who held his head
high – Barrabas, the revolutionary. God knew that the
people would put the weaker one to death so that he
could prove his love.’
He concluded, ‘And regardless of which choice they
made, it was the Son of God who was going to be crucified.’

The Messenger
‘And here all Roads to Santiago become one.’
It was early in the morning when we reached Puente
de la Reina, where the name of the village was etched
into the base of a statue of a pilgrim in medieval garb:
three-cornered hat, cape, scallop shells, and in his hand
a shepherd’s crook. With a gourd – a memorial to the
epic journey, now almost forgotten, that Petrus and I
were reliving.
We had spent the previous night at one of the many
monasteries along the Road. The brother of the gate
who had greeted us had warned us that we were not to
speak a word within the walls of the abbey. A young
monk had led each of us to an alcove, furnished only
with the bare necessities: a hard bed, old but clean
sheets, a pitcher of water and a basin for personal
hygiene. There was no plumbing or hot water, and the
schedule for meals was posted behind the door.
At the time indicated, we had come down to the
dining hall. Because of the vow of silence, the monks
communicated only with their glances, and I had the
impression that their eyes gleamed with more intensity
than those of other people. The supper was served early
71
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 71
at narrow tables where we sat with the monks in their
brown habits. From his seat, Petrus had given me a
signal, and I had understood perfectly what he meant:
he was dying to light a cigarette, but it looked like he
was going to have to go through the entire night without
one. The same was true for me, and I dug a nail into
the cuticle of my thumb, which was already like raw
meat. The moment was too beautiful for me to commit
any kind of cruelty toward myself.
The meal was served; vegetable soup, bread, fish,
and wine. Everyone prayed, and we recited the invocation
with them. Afterward, as we ate, a monk read from
an Epistle of Saint Paul.
‘But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world
to put to shame the wise, and God hath chosen the
weak things of the world to put to shame the things
which are mighty,’ read the monk in a thin, tuneless
voice. ‘We are fools for Christ’s sake. We are made as
filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things
unto this day. But the kingdom of God is not in word
but in power.’
The admonitions of Paul of the Corinthians echoed
off the bare walls of the dining hall throughout the meal.
As we entered Puente de la Reina we had been talking
about the monks of the previous night. I confessed
to Petrus that I had smoked in my room, in mortal fear
that someone would smell my cigarette burning. He
laughed, and I could tell that he had probably been
doing the same thing.
72
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 72
‘Saint John the Baptist went into the desert, but Jesus
went among the sinners, and he traveled endlessly,’
Petrus said, ‘That’s my preference, too.’
In fact, aside from the time he had spent in the
desert, Jesus had spent all of his life among people.
‘Actually, his first miracle was not the saving of
someone’s soul nor the curing of a disease, and it
wasn’t an expulsion of the devil; it was the transformation
of water into an excellent wine at a wedding
because the wine supply of the owner of the house had
run out.’
After Petrus said this, he suddenly stopped walking.
It was so abrupt that I became alarmed and stopped,
too. We were at the bridge that gave its name to the village.
Petrus, though, wasn’t looking at the road in front
of us. His eyes were fastened on two boys who were
playing with a rubber ball at the edge of the river. They
were eight or ten years old and seemed not to have
noticed us. Instead of crossing the bridge, Petrus scrambled
down the bank and approached the two boys. As
always, I followed him without question.
The boys continued to ignore us. Petrus sat down to
watch them at play, until the ball fell close to where he
was seated. With quick movement, he grabbed the ball
and threw it to me.
I caught the ball in the air and waited to see what
would happen.
One of the boys – the elder of the two – approached
me. My first impulse was to throw him the ball, but
73
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 73
Petrus’s behavior had been so unusual that I decided
that I would try to understand what was happening.
‘Give me the ball, Mister,’ said the boy.
I looked at the small figure two meters away from
me. I sensed that there was something familiar about
him. It was the same feeling I had about the gypsy.
The lad asked for the ball several times, and when he
got no response from me, he bent down and picked up
a stone.
‘Give me the ball, or I’ll throw a stone at you,’ he said.
Petrus and the other boy were watching me silently.
The boy’s aggressiveness irritated me.
‘Throw the stone,’ I answered. ‘If it hits me, I’ll come
over there and whack you one.’
I sensed that Petrus gave a sigh of relief. Something
in the back of my mind told me that I had already lived
through this scene.
The boy was frightened by what I said. He let the
stone fall and tried a different approach.
‘There’s a relic here in Puente de la Reina. It used to
belong to a rich pilgrim. I see by your shell and your
knapsack that you are pilgrims. If you give me my ball,
I’ll give you the relic. It’s hidden in the sand here along
the river.’
‘I want to keep the ball,’ I answered, without much
conviction. Actually, I wanted the relic. The boy seemed
to be telling the truth. But maybe Petrus needed the ball
for some reason, and I didn’t want to disappoint him.
He was my guide.
74
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 74
‘Look, Mister, you don’t need the ball,’ the boy said,
now with tears in his eyes. ‘You’re strong, and you’ve
been around, and you know the world. All I know is the
edge of this river, and that ball is my only toy. Please
give it back.’
The boy’s words got to me. But the strangely familiar
surroundings and my feeling that I had already read about
or lived through the situation made me refuse again.
‘No, I need the ball. I’ll give you enough money to
buy another one, even better than this one, but this one
is mine.’
When I said that, time seemed to stop. The surroundings
began to change, even without Petrus’s finger
at my neck; for a fraction of a second, it seemed that we
had been transported to a broad, terrifying, ashen
desert. Neither Petrus nor the other boy was there, just
myself and the boy in front of me. He was old, and his
features were kinder and friendlier. But there was a light
in his eyes that frightened me.
The vision didn’t last more than a second. Then I
was back at Puente de la Reina, where the many Roads
to Santiago, coming from all over Europe, became one.
There in front of me, a boy was asking for his ball, with
a sweet, sad look in his eye.
Petrus approached me, took the ball from my hand,
and gave it to the boy.
‘Where is the relic hidden?’ he asked the boy.
‘What relic?’ he said, as he grabbed his friend’s hand,
jumped away, and threw himself into the water.
75
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 75
We climbed the bank and crossed the bridge. I began
to ask questions about what had happened, and I
described my vision of the desert, but Petrus changed
the subject and said that we should talk about it when
we had traveled further from that spot.
Half an hour later, we came to a stretch of the Road
that still showed vestiges of Roman paving. Here was
another bridge, this one in ruins, and we sat down to
have the breakfast that had been given to us by the
monks: rye bread, yogurt, and goat’s cheese.
‘Why did you want the kid’s ball?’ Petrus asked me.
I told him that I hadn’t wanted the ball – that I had
acted that way because Petrus himself had behaved so
strangely, as if the ball were very important to him.
‘In fact, it was. It allowed you to win out over your
personal devil.’
My personal devil? This was the most ridiculous thing
I had heard during the entire trip. I had spent six days
coming and going in the Pyrenees, I had met a sorcerer
priest who had performed no sorcery, and my finger was
raw meat because every time I had a cruel thought about
myself – from hypochondria, to feelings of guilt, to an
inferiority complex – I had to dig my fingernail into my
wounded thumb. But about one thing Petrus was right:
my negative thinking had diminished considerably. Still,
this story about having a personal devil was something I
had never heard – and I wasn’t going to swallow it easily.
‘Today, before crossing the bridge, I had a strong
feeling of the presence of someone, someone who was
76
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 76
trying to give us a warning. But the warning was more
for you than for me. A battle is coming on very soon,
and you will have to fight the good fight.
‘When you do not know your personal devil, he usually
manifests himself in the nearest person. I looked
around, and I saw those boys playing – and I figured
that it was there that he would probably give his warning.
But I was only following a hunch. I became sure
that it was your personal devil when you refused to give
the ball back.’
I repeated that I had done so because I thought it
was what Petrus wanted.
‘Why me? I never said a word.’
I began to feel a little dizzy. Maybe it was the food,
which I was devouring voraciously after almost an hour
of walking and feeling hungry. Still, I could not escape
the feeling that the boy had seemed familiar.
‘Your personal devil tried three classical approaches:
a threat, a promise, and an attack on your weak side.
Congratulations: you resisted bravely.’
Now I remembered that Petrus had asked the boy
about the relic. At that time, I had thought that the boy’s
response showed that he had tried to fool me. But he
must really have a relic hidden there – a devil never
makes false promises.
‘When the boy could not remember about the relic,
your personal devil had gone away.’
Then he added without blinking, ‘It is time to call
him back. You are going to need him.’

We were sitting on the ruins of the old bridge. Petrus
carefully gathered the remains of the meal and put
them into the paper bag that the monks had given us. In
the fields in front of us, the workers began to arrive for
the day’s plowing, but they were so far away that I
couldn’t hear what they were saying. It was rolling land,
and the cultivated patches created unusual designs
across the landscape. Under our feet, the water course,
almost nonexistent due to the drought, made very little
noise.
‘Before he went out into the world, Christ went into
the desert to talk with his personal devil,’ Petrus began.
‘He learned that he needed to know about people, but
he did not let the devil dictate the rules of the game;
that is how he won.
‘Once, a poet said that no man is an island. In order
to fight the good fight, we need help. We need friends,
and when the friends aren’t nearby, we have to turn solitude
into our main weapon. We need the help of everything
around us in order to take the necessary steps
toward our goal. Everything has to be a personal manifestation
of our will to win the good fight. If we don’t
understand that, then we don’t recognize that we need
everything and everybody, and we become arrogant warriors.
And our arrogance will defeat us in the end,
because we will be so sure of ourselves that we won’t see
the pitfalls there on the field of battle.’
His comments about warriors and battles reminded
me again of Carlos Castaneda’s Don Juan. I asked
78
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 78
myself whether the old medicine man would have given
lessons early in the morning, before his disciple had
even been able to digest his breakfast. But Petrus continued:
‘Over and above the physical forces that surround us
and help us, there are basically two spiritual forces on
our side: an angel and a devil. The angel always protects
us and is a divine gift – you do not have to invoke him.
Your angel’s face is always visible when you look at the
world with eyes that are receptive. He is this river, the
workers in the field, and that blue sky. This old bridge
that helps us to cross the stream was built here by the
hands of anonymous Roman Legionnaires, and the
bridge, too, is the face of your angel. Our grandparents
called him the guardian angel.
‘The devil is an angel, too, but he is a free, rebellious
force. I prefer to call him the messenger, since he is the
main link between you and the world. In antiquity, he
was represented by Mercury and by Hermes
Trismegistus, the messenger of the gods. His arena is
only on the material plane. He is present in the gold of
the Church, because the gold from the earth, and the
earth is your devil. He is present in our work and in our
ways of dealing with money. When we let him loose, his
tendency is to disperse himself. When we exorcise him,
we lose all of the good things that he has to teach us; he
knows a great deal about the world and about human
beings. When we become fascinated by his power, he
owns us and keeps us from fighting the good fight.
79
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 79
‘So the only way to deal with our messenger is to
accept him as a friend – by listening to his advice and
asking for his help when necessary, but never allowing
him to dictate the rules of the game. Like you did with
the boy. To keep the messenger from dictating the rules
of the game, it is necessary first that you know what you
want and then that you know his face and his name.’
‘How can I know them?’ I asked.
And then Petrus taught me the Messenger Ritual.
‘Wait until night to perform it, when it is easier,’
Petrus said. ‘Today, at your first meeting, he will tell you
his name. This name is secret and should never be told
to anyone, not even me. Whoever knows the name of
your messenger can destroy you.’
Petrus got up, and we began to walk. Shortly, we
reached the field where the farmers were working. We
said ‘Buenos días’ to them and went on down the road.
‘If I had to use a metaphor, I would say that your
angel is your armor, and your messenger is your sword.
Armor protects you under any set or circumstances, but
a sword can fall to the ground in the midst of a battle,
or it can kill a friend, or be turned against its owner. A
sword can be used for almost anything … except as
something to sit on,’ he said, laughing.
We stopped in a town for lunch, and the young waiter
who served us was clearly in a bad mood. He didn’t
answer any of our questions, he served the meal sloppily,
and he even succeeded in spilling coffee on Petrus’s
shorts. I watched my guide go through a transformation:
80
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 80
furious, he went to find the owner and complained
loudly about the waiter’s rudeness. He wound up going
to the men’s room and taking off his shorts; the owner
cleaned them and spread them out to dry.
As we waited for the two o’clock sun to dry Petrus’s
shorts, I was thinking about everything we had talked
about that morning. It was true that most of what Petrus
had said about the boy by the river made sense. After
all, I had had a vision of the desert and of a face. But
that story about ‘the messenger’ seemed a little primitive
to me. For a person with any intelligence here in the
twentieth century, the concepts of hell, of sin, and of the
devil did not make much sense. In the Tradition, whose
teachings I had followed for much longer that I had followed
the Road to Santiago, the messenger was a spirit
that ruled the forces of the earth and was always a
friend. He was often used in magical operations but
never as an ally or counsellor with regard to daily
events. Petrus had led me to believe that I could use the
friendship of the messenger as a means to improve my
work and my dealings with the world. Beside being profane,
this idea seemed to me to be childish.
But I had sworn to Mme Lourdes that I would give
total obedience to my guide. Once again, I had to dig
my nail into my red, raw thumb.
‘I should not have put him down,’ Petrus said about
the waiter after we had left. ‘I mean, after all, he didn’t
spill that coffee on me but on the world he hated. He
knows that there is a huge world out there that extends

The Messenger Ritual
1. Sit down and relax completely. Let your mind
wander and your thinking flow without
restraint. After a while, begin to repeat to
yourself, ‘Now I am relaxed, and I am in the
deepest kind of sleep.’
2. When you feel that your mind is no longer
concerned with anything, imagine a billow of
fire to your right. Make the flames lively and
brilliant. Then quietly say, ‘I order my
subconscious to show itself. I order it to open
and reveal its magic secrets.’ Wait a bit, and
concentrate only on the fire. If an image
appears, it will be a manifestation of your
subconscious. Try to keep it alive.
3. Keeping the fire always to your right, now begin
to imagine another billow of fire to your left.
When the flames are lively, say the following
words quietly: ‘May the power of the Lamb,
which manifests itself in everything and
everyone, manifest itself also in me when I
invoke my messenger. (Name of messenger)
will appear before me now.
82
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 82
4. Talk with your messenger, who should appear
between the two fires. Discuss your specific
problems, ask for advice, and give him the
necessary orders.
5. When your conversation has ended, dismiss the
messenger with the following words: ‘I thank
the Lamb for the miracle I have performed. May
(name of messenger) return whenever he is
invoked, and when he is far away, may he help
me to carry on my work.’
Note: On the first invocation – or during the first
invocations, depending on the ability of the person
performing the ritual to concentrate – do not say
the name of the messenger. Just say “he.” If the
ritual is well performed, the messenger should
immediately reveal his name telepathically. If not,
insist until you learn his name, and only then begin
the conversation. The more the ritual is repeated,
the stronger the presence of the messenger will be
and the more rapid his actions.

well beyond the borders of his imagination. And his
participation in that world is limited to getting up early,
going to the bakery, waiting on whoever comes by, and
masturbating every night, dreaming about the women
he will never get to know.’
It was the time of day when we usually stopped
for our siesta, but Petrus had decided to keep walking.
He said that it was a way of doing penance for
his intolerance. And I, who had not done a thing,
had to trudge along with him under the hot sun. I
was thinking about the good fight and the millions
of souls who, right then, were scattered all over the
planet, doing things they didn’t want to do. The
Cruelty Exercise, in spite of having made my thumb
raw, was helping me. It had helped me to see how my
mind could betray me, pushing me into situations I
wanted no part of and into feelings that were no help
to me. Right then, I began to hope that Petrus was
right: that a messenger really did exist and that I
could talk to him about practical matters and ask
him for help with my day-to-day problems. I was
anxious for night to fall.
Meanwhile, Petrus could not stop talking about the
waiter. Finally, he wound up convincing himself that he
had acted properly; once again, he used a Christian
argument to make his case.
‘Christ forgave the adulterous woman but cursed the
grower who would not give him a fig. And I am not
here, either, just to be a nice guy.’
84
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 84
That was it. In his view, the matter was settled. Once
again, the Bible had saved him.
We reached Estella at almost nine o’clock at night. I
took a bath, and we went down to eat. The author of the
first guide for the Jacobean route, Aymeric Picaud, had
described Estella as a ‘fertile place, with good bread and
great wine, meat, and fish. Its river, the Ega, has good,
fresh, clean water.’ I didn’t drink the river water, but as
far as the menu at our restaurant was concerned,
Picaud’s assessment was still right, even after eight centuries.
It offered braised leg of lamb, artichoke hearts,
and a Rioja wine from a very good year. We sat at the
table for a long time, talking about inconsequential
things and enjoying the wine. But finally Petrus said
that it was a good time for me to have my first contact
with my messenger.
We went out to look around the city. Some alleys led
directly to the river – as they do in Venice – and I
decided to sit down in one of them. Petrus knew that
from that point on it was I who would conduct the ceremony,
so he hung back.
I looked at the river for a long time. Its water and its
sound began to take me out of this world and to create
a profound serenity in me. I closed my eyes and imagined
the first billow of fire. It was not easy to imagine at
first, but finally it appeared.
I pronounced the ritual words, and another billow
of fire appeared to my left. The space between the two
billows, illuminated by the fires, was completely empty.
85
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 85
I kept looking at the space for a while, trying not to
think so that the messenger would manifest himself.
But instead of his appearing, various exotic scenes
began to appear – the entrance to a pyramid, a woman
dressed in pure gold, some black men dancing around a
fire. The images came and went in rapid succession, and
I let them flow uncontrolled. There also appeared some
stretches of the Road that I had traversed with Petrus –
byways, restaurants, forests – until, with no warning, the
ashen desert that I had seen that morning appeared
between the two fires. And there, looking at me, was the
friendly man with the traitorous look in his eyes.
He laughed, and I smiled in my trance. He showed
me a closed bag, then opened it and looked inside – but
in such a way that I could not see into it. Then a name
came to my mind: Astrain.*
I began to envision the name and make it dance
between the two fires, and the messenger gave a nod of
approval; I had learned his name.
It was time to end the exercise. I said the ritual words
and extinguished the fires – first on the left and then on
the right. I opened my eyes, and there was the river Ega
in front of me.
‘It was much less difficult than I had imagined,’ I
said to Petrus, after I had told him about everything that
had occurred between the two fires.
86

* This is not the real name.

‘This was your first contact – a meeting to establish
mutual recognition and mutual friendship. Your conversations
with the messenger will be productive if you
invoke him every day and discuss your problems with
him. But you have to know how to distinguish between
what is real assistance and what is a trap. Keep your
sword ready every time you meet with him.’
‘But I don’t have my sword yet,’ I answered.
‘Right, so he can’t cause you much damage. But even
so, don’t make it easy for him.’
The ritual having ended, I left Petrus and went back
to the hotel. In bed, I thought about the poor young
waiter who had served us lunch. I felt like going back
there and teaching him the Messenger Ritual, telling
him that he could change everything if he wanted to.
But it was useless to try to save the world: I hadn’t even
been able to save myself yet.*
87

* This description of my first experience with the Messenger Ritual
is incomplete. Actually, Petrus explained the meaning of the
visions, of the memories, and of the bag that Astrain showed me.
But since each meeting with the messenger is different for every
person, I do not want to insist on my own personal experience as
it might influence the experience of others.

Love
‘Talking with your messenger doesn’t mean asking questions
about the world of the spirits,’ Petrus said the next
day. ‘The messenger performs only one function for
you: he helps you with regard to the material world.
And he will give you this help only if you know exactly
what it is that you want.’
We had stopped in a town to have something to
drink. Petrus had ordered a beer, and I asked for a soft
drink. My fingers were abstract designs in the water on
the table, and I was worried.
‘You told me that the messenger had manifested
himself in the boy because he needed to tell me something.’
‘Something urgent,’ he confirmed.
We talked some more about messengers, angels, and
devils. It was difficult for me to accept such a practical
application of the mysteries of the Tradition. Petrus said
that we are always seeking some kind of reward. But I
reminded him that Jesus had said that the rich man
would not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
‘But Jesus rewarded the man who knew how to make
his master more adept. People did not believe in Jesus
89
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 89
just because he was an outstanding orator: he had to
perform miracles and reward those who followed him.’
‘No one is going to blaspheme Jesus in my bar,’ said
the owner, who had been listening to our conversation.
‘No one is blaspheming Jesus,’ Petrus answered.
‘People speak poorly of Jesus when they commit the sin
of taking his name in vain. Like all of you did out there
in the plaza.’
The owner hesitated for a moment. But then he
answered, ‘I had nothing to do with that. I was only a
child at the time.’
‘The guilty ones are always the others,’ Petrus mumbled.
The owner went into the kitchen, and I asked
Petrus what he was talking about.
‘Fifty years ago, in this twentieth century of ours, a
gypsy was burned at the stake out there in the plaza. He
was accused of sorcery and of blaspheming the sacred
host. The case was lost amid the news of the Spanish
civil war, and no one remembers it today. Except the
people who live here.’
‘How do you know about it, Petrus?’
‘Because I have already walked the Road to Santiago.’
We went on drinking there in the empty bar. The sun
was hot, and it was our siesta time. A few minutes later,
the owner reappeared, accompanied by the town priest.
‘Who are you people?’ asked the priest.
Petrus showed him the scallop shells sewn to his
knapsack. For twelve hundred years, pilgrims had passed
along the Road in front of the bar, and the tradition was
90
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 90
that every pilgrim was respected and welcomed under
any circumstance. The priest changed his tone.
‘How can it be that pilgrims on the Road to Santiago
are speaking poorly of Jesus?’ he asked, in a tone that
was appropriate to a catechism.
‘Nobody here was speaking poorly of Jesus. We were
speaking poorly of the crimes committed in the name
of Jesus. Like the gypsy that was burned there in the
square.’
The shells on Petrus’s knapsack had also changed the
owner’s attitude. Now he addressed us with some respect.
‘The curse of the gypsy is still with us today,’ he said
and the priest looked at him reprovingly.
Petrus wanted to know how. The priest said that
these were stories told by the villagers and that the
church did not approve of them. But the owner of the
bar went on:
‘Before the gypsy died, he said that the youngest
child in the village was going to receive and incorporate
his devils. And that when that child became old and
died, the devils would pass on to another child. And so
on, for all the centuries to come.’
‘The soil here is the same as the soil in the other
towns around here,’ said the priest. ‘When the other
towns have a drought, we do, too. Nothing has happened
here with us that has not happened in the neighboring
towns, too. This whole story is a fantasy.’
‘Nothing has happened because we isolated the
curse,’ said the owner.
91
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 91
‘Well, then, let’s see it,’ answered Petrus. The priest
laughed and said that that was no way to talk. The
owner of the bar made the sign of the cross. But neither
of them moved.
Petrus got the check and insisted that someone take
us to the person who had inherited the curse. The
priest excused himself, saying that he had been interrupted
at something important and had to get back to
his church. And he left before anyone could say anything.
The owner of the bar looked at Petrus fearfully.
‘Not to worry,’ said my guide. ‘Just show us the house
where the curse resides. We are going to try to rid the
town of it.’
The owner of the bar went out into the dusty street
with us. The hot sun of the afternoon beat down everywhere.
We walked to the outskirts of the town, and he
pointed to a house set off by itself at the side of the
Road.
‘We always send meals, clothing, everything they
need,’ he apologized. ‘But not even the priest goes in
there.’
We said good-bye to him and walked toward the
house. The owner of the bar waited there, perhaps
thinking that we would pass it by. But Petrus went up to
the house and knocked on the door, and when I looked
around, the bar owner had disappeared.
A woman of about seventy came to the door. At her
side was an enormous black dog, wagging his tail and
92
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 92
apparently happy to see company. The woman asked
what we wanted; she said she was busy washing clothes
and had left some pots on the fire. She did not seem
surprised by our visit. I figured that many pilgrims, not
knowing about the curse, must have knocked on the
door seeking shelter.
‘We are pilgrims on the Road to Compostela, and we
need some hot water,’ Petrus said. ‘I knew that you
would not refuse us.’
With a show of irritation, the woman opened the
door. We went into a small room, clean but poorly furnished.
There was a sofa with its stuffing coming out, a
bureau, and a Formica-topped table with two chairs. On
the bureau was an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus,
some saints, and a crucifix made of mirrors. Through
one of the two doors in the room, I could see the bedroom.
The woman led Petrus through the other door
into the kitchen.
‘I have some water boiling,’ she said. ‘Let me get you
a container, and you can both get going.’
I was there in the living room, alone with the huge
dog. He wagged his tail, docile and contented. The
woman came back with an old can, filled it with water,
and held it out to Petrus.
‘There. Go with God’s blessing.’
But Petrus did not move. He took a tea bag from his
knapsack, put it in the can, and said that he would like
to share the little he had with her in appreciation for
her welcome.
93
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 93
The woman, clearly upset now, brought two cups
and sat down at the table with Petrus. I kept looking at
the dog as I listened to their conversation.
‘They told me in the village that there was a curse on
this house,’ Petrus commented boldly. The dog’s eyes
seemed to light up, as if he had understood what had
been said. The old woman stood up immediately.
‘That’s a lie. It’s an old superstition. Please finish
your tea, because I have lots of things to do.’
The dog sensed the woman’s sudden mood change.
He remained still but alert. But Petrus continued to do
what he was doing. He slowly poured the tea into the
cup, raised it to his lips, and put it down on the table
without drinking a drop.
‘That’s really hot,’ he said. ‘I think I will wait until it
cools off a bit.’
The woman did not sit down again. She was visibly
uncomfortable with us there and clearly regretted
having opened the door. She noticed that I was staring
fixedly at the dog and called him to her. The animal
obeyed, but when he reached her side, he turned to
look at me.
‘This is why he did it, my friend,’ Petrus said, looking
at me. ‘This is why your messenger appeared yesterday
in the child.’
Suddenly I realized that I was not just looking at the
dog. As soon as I had come in, the animal had hypnotized
me and had kept my eyes fastened on him. The
dog was staring at me and making me do as he wanted.
94
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 94
I began to feel weak, as if I would like to lie down and
sleep on the torn couch; it was really hot outside, and I
did not feel much like walking. The feelings all seemed
strange to me, and I had the impression that I was
falling into a trap. The dog continued to looked fixedly
at me, and the more he looked at me, the more tired I
felt.
‘Let’s go,’ said Petrus, getting up and offering me the
cup of tea. ‘Drink a bit of tea, because the lady wants us
to get going.’
I hesitated, but I took the cup, and the hot tea
revived me. I wanted to say something, ask what the
animal’s name was, but I could not get my voice to
work. Something inside me had been aroused, something
that Petrus had not taught me but that nevertheless
began to manifest itself. I felt an uncontrollable
desire to say strange words, the meaning of which I
didn’t even know. I thought that Petrus had put something
in the tea. Everything began to blur, and I heard
only very faintly the woman repeat to Petrus that we
had to leave. I was in a state of euphoria, and I decided
to speak the strange words that were coming to my
mind.
All I could see in the room was the dog. When I
began to say those strange words, the dog started to
growl. He understood what I was saying. I became more
excited and continued to speak, louder and louder. The
dog rose and bared his teeth. He was no longer the
docile animal I had seen on arrival but something awful
95
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 95
and threatening that could attack me at any moment. I
knew that the words were protecting me, and I began to
speak even louder, focusing all of my energies on the
dog. I felt that I had a different power within me and
that it could keep the animal from attacking me.
From that point on, everything began to happen in
slow motion. I saw the woman come toward me,
shrieking and trying to push me out of the house. And
I saw Petrus holding the woman back. The dog paid
no attention at all to their struggle. Snarling and
baring his teeth, he continued to stare at me. I was
trying to understand the strange language I was speaking,
but each time I stopped to think about it, my
power would weaken and the dog would start coming
toward me; he was growing stronger. I began to
scream, giving up my attempt at understanding, and
the woman began to scream, too. The dog barked and
threatened me, but so long as I continued speaking, I
was safe. I heard raucous laughter, but I did not know
if it was really occurring or if it was in my imagination.
Suddenly, a strong wind swept through the house,
and the dog howled and leapt on me. I raised my arm to
protect my face, shouted something, and waited to see
what the impact would be.
The dog had thrown himself upon me with all his
strength, and I fell onto the couch. For a few moments,
our eyes were locked on each other’s; in the next
second, he ran from the house.
96
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 96
I began to cry hysterically. I thought of my family,
my wife, and my friends. I experienced an enormous
feeling of love and, at the same time, an absurd happiness,
because all of a sudden I understood everything
about the dog.
Petrus took me by the arm and led me outside, as
the woman pushed us both from behind. I looked
around, and there was no sign of the dog. I hugged
Petrus and continued to cry as we walked along in the
sunlight.
The next part of the journey is a blank; I only came
to my senses later at a fountain, where Petrus was
throwing water in my face and on the back of my neck. I
asked for some to drink, and he said that if I drank anything
then, I would vomit. I was a little nauseated, but I
felt good. An immense love for everything and everybody
had invaded my being. I looked around me and
sensed the trees along the edge of the Road, the small
fountain where we had stopped, the fresh breeze, and
the bird song from the forest. I was seeing the face of
my angel, as Petrus had told me I would. I asked how
far we were from the woman’s house, and he said we
had been walking for about fifteen minutes.
‘You probably want to know what happened,’ he
said.
Actually that was not important to me at all. I was
just happy about the feelings of love that permeated me.
The dog, the woman, the owner of the bar, everything
was a distant memory that seemed to have nothing to
97
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 97
do with what I was feeling now. I told Petrus that I
would like to go on walking because I was feeling so
well.
I got up, and we returned to the Road to Santiago.
Throughout the rest of the afternoon, I said almost
nothing, delighting in the agreeable feeling that seemed
to fill me. I still thought that perhaps Petrus had put
something in the tea, but this was no longer important.
We arrived at a hotel at eight o’clock that night, and
I was still in this state of beautitude, although it had
diminished somewhat. The owner asked me for my
passport so that I could register, and I gave it to him.
‘You’re from Brazil? I’ve been there. I stayed at a
hotel on Ipanema Beach.’
That absurd message brought me back to reality.
There, along the Jacobean route, in a town that had
been built centuries ago was a hotel keeper who had
been to Ipanema Beach.
‘I’m ready to talk,’ I told Petrus. ‘I have to know what
happened today’.
The sense of beautitude had passed. Reason took its
place, and my fear of the unknown, along with an
urgent need to get my feet back on the ground, had
returned.
‘After we eat,’ said Petrus.
Petrus asked the hotel owner to turn on the television
but to leave the sound off. He said that this was the
best way for me to hear everything he said without
asking a lot of questions, because part of me would be
98
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 98
watching the television screen. He asked me how much
I remembered of what had happened. I answered that I
remembered everything except the part where we had
walked to the fountain.
‘That part is not important to the story,’ he answered.
On the television screen, a film having something to do
with coal mines began. The actors were dressed in turnof-
the-century clothing.
‘Yesterday, when I sensed the urgency in your messenger,
I knew that a battle along the Road to Santiago
was about to begin. You are here to find your sword and
learn the RAM practices. But every time a guide leads a
pilgrim, there is at least one situation that goes beyond
the control of both of them. It represents a kind of practical
test of what is being taught. In your case, this was
the encounter with the dog.
‘The details of the battle and the explanation for the
many devils that can be present in an animal I will
explain later. What is important now is that you understand
that the woman was already used to the curse. She
had accepted it as normal, and the attitudes of the
world were fine with her. She had learned to be satisfied
with very little.
‘When you exorcised the poor old woman’s demons,
you also unbalanced her universe. The other day we
talked about the cruelty that people are capable of
inflicting on themselves. Often, when we try to demonstrate
that life is good and generous, such people reject
the idea as if it came from the devil. People don’t like to
99
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 99
ask too much of life because they are afraid they will be
defeated. But if someone wants to fight the good fight,
that person must view the world as if it were a marvellous
treasure waiting to be discovered and won.’
Petrus asked me if I knew what I was doing there on
the Road to Santiago.
‘I am searching for my sword,’ I answered.
‘And what do you want your sword for?’
‘I want it because it will bring me the power and the
wisdom of the Tradition.’
I felt that he was not too happy with my response.
But he continued, ‘You are here, searching for a reward.
You are daring to dream, and you are doing everything
possible to make your dream come true. You need to
have a better idea of what it is that you are going to do
with your sword; this has to be clearer to you before we
can find it. But there is one thing in your favor: you are
looking for a reward. You are walking the Road to
Santiago only because you want to be rewarded for your
effort. I have noticed that you have applied everything I
have taught you; you have been looking for a practical
outcome. That is very positive.
‘The only thing missing is your learning how to
combine the RAM practices with your own intuition.
The language of your heart is what is going to determine
the best way to find and use your sword. If you can’t
bring the two together, the exercises and the RAM practices
will become simply a part of the useless wisdom of
the Tradition.’

Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 100
Petrus had told me this before, in a different way,
and although I agreed with him, it wasn’t what I wanted
to hear about. There were two aspects of the experience
that I could not understand: the strange language I had
spoke and my feeling of love and happiness after having
evicted the dog.
‘The sensation of happiness occurred because your
action was suffused with agape.’
‘You talk a lot about agape, but you haven’t really
explained to me what it is. I have a feeling we are dealing
with something that relates to a higher form of love.’
‘That’s exactly right. In a little while, the time will
come for you to experience that intense love – the love
that consumes the one who loves. Meanwhile, be happy
knowing that this love has manifested itself freely in
you.’
‘I have had this sensation before, but it was brief,
and different somehow. It always happened after a professional
triumph, a win, or when I felt that Lady Luck
was being generous with me. But when the feeling
arose, I always pulled back; I felt frightened of experiencing
it too intensely – as if the happiness could cause
envy in others or as if I were unworthy of it.’
‘All of us, before we learn about agape, act that way,’
he said, with his gaze on the television screen.
I asked him about the strange language I had spoken.
‘That was a surprise to me. That is not a practice of
the Road to Santiago. It is a divine grace, and it is one of
the RAM practices for the Road to Rome.’
101
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 101
I had already heard some things about the divine
graces, but I asked Petrus to explain them to me.
‘They are gifts from the Holy Ghost that manifest
themselves in people. There are a number of different
kinds: the gift of curing, the gift of miracles, the gift of
prophecy, among others. You experienced the gift of
tongues, which is what the apostles experienced at
Pentecost.
‘The gift of tongues is related to direct communication
with the Holy Ghost. It is used in powerful oratory,
in exorcisms – as was your case – and in wisdom. Your
days on the Road and the RAM practices not only led to
the danger that the dog represented for you but also by
chance gave rise to the gift of tongues. It won’t happen
again, unless you find your sword and decide to walk
the Road to Rome. In any case, it was a good omen.’
I watched the silent television screen. The story of
the coal mines had been transformed into a succession
of men and women talking and arguing. Every so often,
an actor and an actress would kiss.
‘One other thing,’ said Petrus. ‘It may be that you are
going to meet up with that dog again. Next time, don’t
try to invoke the gift of tongues, because it won’t come
back. Trust in what your intuition is going to tell you. I
am going to teach you another RAM practice that will
enhance your intuition. With it, you will begin to learn
the secret language of your mind, and that language will
be very useful to you for the rest of your life.’
Petrus turned the television off, just as I was begin-
102
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 102
ning to get involved in the story. He went to the bar and
asked for a bottle of mineral water. We each drank a
little, and he took what was left outdoors.
We felt the fresh air, and for a few moments neither
of us said anything. The night was quiet, and the Milky
Way overhead reminded me again that my goal was to
find my sword.
After some time, Petrus taught me the Water
Exercise.
‘I’m tired; I’m going to bed,’ he said. ‘But do this
exercise now. Call up your intuition again, your secret
side. Don’t be concerned about logic, because water is a
fluid element, and it does not allow itself to be controlled
easily. But water, little by little and in a nonviolent
way, is going to build a new relationship
between you and the universe.’
And before he went through the door of the hotel,
he added, ‘It is not often that someone gets help from a
dog.’
I continued to enjoy the freshness and the silence of
the night. The hotel was out in the country, and there
was no one there with me. I remembered the owner,
who had been to Ipanema; he must find it absurd to see
me there in that arid place, burned by the sun that
shone down with such ferocity day after day.
I was getting sleepy, so I decided to do the exercise
right away. I emptied the remaining water onto the
cement and a small puddle formed. I did not have any
image or shape in mind, and I wasn’t seeking one. I

The Arousal of Intuition
(The Water Exercise)
Make a puddle of water on a smooth, nonabsorbant
surface. Look into the puddle for a while.
Then, begin to play with it, without any particular
commitment or objective. Make designs that mean
absolutely nothing.
Do this exercise for a week, allowing at least ten
minutes each time.
Don’t look for practical results from this
exercise; it is simply calling up your intuition, little
by little. When this intuition begins to manifest
itself at other times of the day, always trust in it.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 104
swirled my fingers through the cold water, and I experienced
the same kind of hypnosis that one feels when
staring into the flames of a fire. I thought about nothing;
I was just playing – playing with a puddle of water.
I made some streaks at the edge of the puddle, and it
seemed to become a wet sun; but the streaks quickly
rejoined the puddle and disappeared. With the palm of
my hand, I batted at the center of the puddle; the water
splashed away, covering the cement with droplets, black
stars on a gray background. I was completely lost in that
absurd exercise, an exercise that had not the slightest
purpose but was delightful to do. I felt that my mind
had stopped working almost completely, a feeling I had
previously achieved only after long periods of meditation
and relaxation. At the same time, something told
me that down deep, in places that my mind could not
reach, a force was being born and becoming ready to
manifest itself.
I stayed there for quite a while playing with the
puddle, and it was difficult to give up the exercise. If
Petrus had taught me the water exercise at the beginning
of the journey, there is no doubt that I would have
found it to be a waste of time. But now, having spoken
in strange tongues and having exorcised devils, that
puddle of water established a contact – however fragile
– with the Milky Way above me. It reflected the stars,
created designs I could not understand, and gave me the
feeling not that I was wasting time but that I was creating
a new code for communicating with the world. It
105
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 105
was the soul’s secret code – the language that we know
but so seldom hear.
When I came back to myself, it was late. The lights at
the door had been turned off, and I entered the hotel
quietly. In my room, once again I invoked Astrain. He
appeared more clearly, and I spoke to him for a while
about my sword and about my goals in life. For now, he
made no answer, but Petrus had told me that as the
invocations continued, Astrain would become a live
and powerful presence at my side.

Marriage
Logroño is one of the largest cities through which pilgrims
traveling the Jacobean route pass. The only other
city of any size that we had entered had been Pamplona
– but we had not spent the night there. On the afternoon
that we arrived in Logroño, though, the city was
preparing for a great festival, and Petrus suggested that
we stay there, at least for one night.
I was used to the silence and freedom of the countryside,
so the idea did not much appeal to me. It had
been five days since the incident with the dog, and
every night since then, I had invoked Astrain and performed
the Water Exercise. I was feeling very calm,
and I was more and more aware of the importance of
the Road to Santiago in my life and of the question of
what I was going to do after the pilgrimage had
ended. The area we walked through was like a desert,
the meals were seldom very good, and the long days
on the Road were exhausting, but I was living my
dream.
All of these feelings disappeared the day we arrived
at Logroño. Instead of the warm, pure air of the fields,
we found a city crowded with cars, journalists, and
107
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 107
television equipment. Petrus went into the first bar we
saw to ask what was happening.
‘You didn’t know? Today is the wedding of Colonel
M.’s daughter,’ said the bartender. ‘We are going to have
a huge public banquet in the square, and I am closing
early today.’
It was impossible to find rooms at a hotel, but eventually
we were given lodging at the home of an elderly
couple who had noticed the shells on Petrus’s knapsack.
We showered, I put on the only trousers that I had
brought, and we left for the town square.
Dozens of workers, perspiring in their black suits,
were putting the finishing touches on the tables that
had been placed all over the square. National television
crews were filming the preparations. We went down a
narrow street that led to the church of the Royal
Santiago parish, where the ceremony was about to
begin.
Flocking to the church were great numbers of welldressed
people. The women’s makeup was running in
the heat, and their children, dressed in white, were irritable.
Some fireworks were exploding overhead as a
long black limousine stopped at the main gate. It was
the groom arriving. There was no room for Petrus and
me in the church, so we decided to go back to the
square.
Petrus wanted to scout around, but I sat down on
one of the benches, waiting for the ceremony to end
and the banquet to begin. Nearby, a popcorn vendor,
108
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 108
hoping for a windfall profit, awaited the crowd from the
church.
‘Are you one of the invited guests?’ he asked me.
‘No,’ I answered. ‘We are pilgrims on our way to
Compostela.’
‘There’s a train that goes there straight from Madrid,
and if you leave on a Friday, you get your hotel free.’
‘Yes, but we are doing a pilgrimage.’
The vendor looked at me and said respectfully,
‘Pilgrimages are made by saints.’
I decided not to get into that discussion. He said
that his daughter had already been married but was
now separated from her husband.
‘In Franco’s time, there was more respect,’ he said.
‘Nowadays, no one cares about the family.’
Despite my being in a strange country, where it is
never advisable to talk politics, I could not let this pass
without a response. I said that Franco had been a dictator
and that nothing during his time could have been
better than now.
The vendor’s face turned red.
‘Who do you think you are, talking like that?’
‘I know this country’s history. I know the war the
people fought for their freedom. I have read about the
crimes of the Franco forces during the Spanish civil war.’
‘Well, I fought in that war. I was there when my
family’s blood was spilled. Whatever stories you have
read don’t interest me; what I’m concerned about is
what happens to my family. I fought against Franco, but
109
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 109
when he won the war, life was better for me. I’m not a
beggar, and I have my little popcorn stand. It wasn’t this
socialist government we have now that helped me. I’m
worse off now than I was before.’
I remembered what Petrus had said about people
being content with very little. I decided not to press my
point of view, and I moved to another bench.
When Petrus came back, I told him about my
exchange with the popcorn vendor.
‘Conversation is useful,’ he said, ‘when people want
to convince themselves that what they are saying is
right. I am a member of the Italian Communist Party.
But I didn’t know about this fascist side of you.’
‘What do you mean, fascist side?’ I asked him
angrily.
‘Well, you helped the popcorn man to convince
himself that Franco was good. Maybe he never knew
why. Now he knows.’
‘Well, I’m just as surprised to learn that the ICP
believes in the gifts of the Holy Ghost.’
‘Well, I have to be careful about what the neighbors
will think,’ he said, laughing.
The fireworks started up again, as musicians climbed
to the bandstand and tuned their instruments. The festival
was about to begin.
I looked up at the sky. It was growing dark, and the
stars were beginning to appear. Petrus went over to one
of the waiters and brought back two plastic cups full of
wine.
110
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 110
‘It is good luck to have a drink before the party
begins,’ he said, handing me one of the cups. ‘Have some
of this. It will help you forget about the popcorn man.’
‘I wasn’t even thinking about him anymore.’
‘Well, you should. Because what happened with him
is an example of mistaken behavior. We are always
trying to convert people to a belief in our own explanation
of the universe. We think that the more people
there are who believe as we do, the more certain it will
be that what we believe is the truth. But it doesn’t work
that way at all.
‘Look around. Here is a huge party about to begin. A
commemoration. Many different things are being celebrated
simultaneously: the father’s hope that his daughter
would marry, the daughter’s wish for the same thing,
the groom’s dreams. That’s good, because they believe
in their dreams and want to demonstrate to everyone
that they have achieved their goals. It is not a party that
is being held to convince anyone of anything, so it’s
going to be a lot of fun. From what I can see, they are
people who have fought the good fight of love.’
‘But you are trying to convince me, Petrus, by guiding
me along the Road to Santiago.’
He gave me a cold look.
‘I am only teaching you the RAM practices. But you
will find your sword only if you discover that the Road
and the truth and the life are in your heart.’
Petrus pointed to the sky, where the stars were now
clearly visible.
111
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 111
‘There is no religion that is capable of bringing all of
the stars together, because if this were to happen, the
universe would become a gigantic, empty space and
would lose its reason for existence. Every star – and
every person – has their own space and their own special
characteristics. There are green stars, yellow stars,
blue stars, and white stars, and there are comets, meteors
and meteorites, nebulas and rings. What appear
from down here to be a huge number of bodies that are
similar to each other are really a million different
things, spread over a space that is beyond human comprehension.’
A rocket from the fireworks burst, and its light
obscured the sky for a moment. A shower of brilliant
green streamers fell to the ground.
‘Earlier, we only heard their noise because of the
daylight. Now we can see their light,’ Petrus said. ‘That’s
the only change people can aspire to.’
The bride came out of the church, and people
shouted and threw their handfuls of rice. She was a thin
girl of about sixteen, and she held the arm of a boy in a
tuxedo. The congregation appeared and began to move
toward the square.
‘Look, there’s the colonel … Oh, look at the bride’s
dress. How beautiful,’ said some boys near us. The
guests took their places at the tables, the waiters served
the wine, and the band began to play. The popcorn
vendor was surrounded by a mob of screaming boys
who made their purchases and then scattered the empty
112
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 112
bags on the ground. I imagined that for the townspeople
of Logroño, at least that night, the rest of the world
– with its threat of nuclear war, unemployment, and
murders – did not exist. It was a festival night, the tables
had been placed in the square for the people, and everyone
felt important.
A television crew came toward us, and Petrus averted
his face. But the men passed us by, heading for one of
the guests who sat near us. I recognized immediately
who he was: Antonio, the man who had led the Spanish
fans in their cheers at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986.
When the interview was over, I went up to him and told
him that I was a Brazilian; feigning anger, he complained
about a goal of which Spain had been robbed
in the opening round of the Cup.*
But then he gave me a hug, and said that Brazil would
soon once again have the best players in the world.
‘How do you manage to see the game when your
back is always to the field and you are inciting the fans,’
I asked. It was something I had noticed over and over
again during the television transmissions of the World
Cup games.
‘That’s what gives me satisfaction. Helping the fans
believe in victory.’
113
The Pilgrimage
* In the game between Spain and Brazil at that World Cup in
Mexico, a Spanish goal was disallowed because the referee had
not seen the ball cross the goal line before rebounding out.
Brazil ended up winning that game 1–0.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:40 PM Page 113
And then, as if he too were a guide on the Road to
Santiago, he said, ‘Fans who lack the faith can make a
team lose a game it is already winning.’
Manolo was then grabbed by others who wanted to
interview him, but I stood there thinking about what
he had said. Even without ever having walked the Road
to Santiago, he knew what it was to fight the good
fight.
I found Petrus hiding behind some trees, obviously
uncomfortable with the presence of the television cameras.
It was only after their lights had been turned off
that he emerged from the trees and relaxed a bit. We
asked for two more cups of wine, I fixed myself a plate
of canapés, and Petrus found a table where we could sit
with some of the guests.
The newlyweds cut into a huge wedding cake. People
cheered.
‘They must really love each other,’ I said.
‘Of course they do,’ said a dark-suited man sitting
with us. ‘Have you ever heard of anyone marrying for
any other reason?’
I kept my answer to myself, remembering what
Petrus had said about the popcorn vendor. But my
guide didn’t let it pass.
‘Which kind of love are you talking about: eros,
philos, or agape?’
The man looked at him blankly. Petrus got up, filled
his cup, and asked me to walk with him.
‘There are three Greek words that mean love,’ he
114
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 114
began. ‘Today, you are seeing a manifestation of eros,
the feeling of love that exists between two people.’
The bride and groom were smiling for the photographers
and accepting congratulations.
‘It appears that these two really do love each other,’
he said, looking at the couple. ‘And they believe that
their love will grow. But shortly, they will be alone with
each other, struggling to earn a living, build a house, and
share their adventure. This is what ennobles love and
dignifies it. He will do his time in the army. She is probably
a good cook and will be an excellent housewife,
because she has been trained since she was a child for
that role. She will be good company for him, they’ll have
children, and they will feel that they are building something
together. They’ll be fighting the good fight. So even
if they have problems, they will never be really unhappy.
‘However, this story that I am telling you could go a
very different way. He might begin to feel that he’s not
free enough to express all of the eros, all of the love that
he has for other women. She might begin to feel that
she gave up a brilliant career in order to be with her
husband. So instead of creating something together,
each could begin to feel robbed of a means of expressing
love. Eros, the spirit that unites them, would begin
to reveal only its negative side. And what God had provided
to humans as their noblest sentiment would
become a source of hatred and destructiveness.’
I looked around me. Eros was present in many of the
relationships there. The Water Exercise had awakened
115
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 115
the language of my heart, and I was seeing people in a
different way. Maybe it was the days of solitude on the
road, or maybe it was the RAM practices, but I could feel
the presence of good eros and evil eros, just as Petrus
had described.
‘It’s strange,’ Petrus said, sensing the same thing.
‘Whether it’s good or evil, the face of eros is never the
same for any two people. Just like the stars I was talking
about half an hour ago. And no one can escape eros.
Everyone needs its presence, despite the fact that many
times, eros makes us feel apart from the world, trapped
in our solitude.’
The band began to play a waltz. The guests went to a
small cement section in front of the bandstand and
started to dance. The alcohol was making itself felt, and
people were perspiring more and smiling more. I
noticed a girl dressed in blue who looked as if she had
waited for this wedding just to have the chance to dance
the waltz – she wanted to dance with someone who
would embrace her in the way she had dreamed of since
adolescence. She was watching a well-dressed boy, who
wore a white suit and stood among his friends. They
were all talking and had not noticed that the waltz had
begun. Nor did they see that a few yards away, a girl in a
blue dress looked longingly at one of them.
I thought about small towns and marriage to the
boy one has dreamed of since childhood.
The girl in blue saw that I was watching her and tried
to conceal herself among her girlfriends. As she did, the
116
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 116
boy searched for her with his eyes. When he saw that
she was there with her friends, he went back to his conversation
with his own group.
I pointed out the two of them to Petrus. He watched
the game of glances for a while and then went back to
his cup of wine.
‘They act as if it were shameful to make any show of
love,’ was all he said.
A girl near us was staring at Petrus and me. She must
have been half our age. Petrus held up his cup of wine
and made a toast in her direction. The girl laughed in
embarrassment and pointed toward her parents, as if to
explain why she did not come closer.
‘That’s the beautiful side of love,’ Petrus said. ‘The
love that dares, the love for two older strangers who
have come from nowhere and will be gone tomorrow –
gone into a world where she would like to travel, too.’
I could hear in his voice that the wine was having an
effect on him.
‘Today, we will talk of love!’ said my guide, a bit
loudly. ‘Let us speak of true love, which grows and
grows, and makes the world go round, and makes
people wise!’
A well-dressed woman near us seemed not to be
paying any attention at all to the party. She went from
table to table, straightening the cups, the china, and the
silverware.
‘See that woman there?’ asked Petrus. ‘The one who’s
straightening things up? Well, as I said, eros has many
117
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 117
faces, and that’s another of them. That’s frustrated love,
with its own kind of unhappiness. She is going to kiss
the bride and groom, but inside she’ll be saying that a
knot has been tied around them. She’s trying to neaten
up the world because she herself is in complete disorder.
And there’ – he pointed toward another couple, the
wife wearing excessive makeup and an elaborate coiffure
– ‘is eros accepted. Social love, without a vestige of
passion. She has accepted her role and has severed any
connection with the world or with the good fight.’
‘You’re being very bitter, Petrus. Isn’t there anyone
here who can be saved?’
‘Of course there is. The girl who was watching us, the
adolescents that are dancing – they know only about
good eros. If they don’t allow themselves to be influenced
by the hypocrisy of the love that dominated the
past generation, the world will certainly be a different
place.’
He pointed to an elderly couple sitting at one of the
tables.
‘And those two, also. They haven’t let themselves be
infected by hypocrisy like the others. They look like
working people. Hunger and need have required them
to work together. They learned the practices you are
learning without ever having heard of RAM. They find
the power of love in the work they do. It’s there that
eros shows its most beautiful face, because it’s united
with that of philos.’
‘What is philos?’
118
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 118
‘Philos is love in the form of friendship. It’s what I
feel toward you and others. When the flame of eros
stops burning, it is philos that keeps a couple together.’
‘And agape?’
‘Today’s not the day to talk about agape. Agape is in
both eros and philos – but that’s just a phrase. Let’s
enjoy the rest of the party without talking about the
love that consumes.’ And Petrus poured some more
wine into his plastic cup.
The happiness around us was contagious. Petrus was
getting drunk, and at first I was a little surprised. But I
remembered what he had said one afternoon: that the
RAM practices made sense only if they could be performed
by the common people.
That night, Petrus seemed to be a person like any
other. He was companionable and friendly, patting
people on the back and talking to anyone who paid
him any attention. A little later, he was so drunk that I
had to help him back to the hotel.
On the way, I took stock of my situation. Here I was,
guiding my guide. I realized that at no time during the
entire journey had Petrus made any effort to appear
wiser, holier, or in any way better than I. All he had
done was to transmit to me his experience with the
RAM practices. Beyond that, he had made a point of
showing that he was just like anyone else – that he experienced
eros, philos, and agape.
This realization made me feel stronger. Petrus was
just another pilgrim on the Road to Santiago.
119

Enthusiasm
‘Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels
… and though I have the gift of prophecy … and have
all faith so that I could remove mountains … and have
not love, I am nothing.’
Petrus was once again quoting from Saint Paul. My
guide felt that the apostle Paul was the major occult
interpreter of Christ’s message. We were fishing that
afternoon after having walked for the whole morning.
No fish had yet perished on the hook, but Petrus didn’t
care about that at all. According to him, fishing was
basically a symbol of the human being’s relationship
with the world: we know why we are fishing, and we
will catch something if we stay with it, but whether we
do or not depends on God’s help.
‘It’s a good idea always to do something relaxing
prior to making an important decision in your life,’ he
said. ‘The Zen monks listen to the rocks growing. I
prefer fishing.’
But at that time of day, because of the heat, even the
fat, lazy fish on the bottom ignored the hook. Whether
the bait was up or down, the result was the same. I
decided to give it up and take a walk through the nearby
121
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 121
woods. I went as far as an old, abandoned cemetery
close to the river – it had a gate that was totally disproportionate
to the size of the burial ground – and then
came back to where Petrus was fishing. I asked about
the cemetery.
‘The gate was part of an ancient hospital for pilgrims,’
he said. ‘But the hospital was abandoned, and
later, someone had the idea of using the facade and
building the cemetery.’
‘Which has also been abandoned.’
‘That’s right. The things of this life don’t last very long.’
I said that he had been nasty the night before in his
judgments of the people at the party, and he was surprised
at me. He said that what we had talked about was
no more or less than we had ourselves experienced in
our personal lives. All of us seek eros, and then when
eros wants to turn itself into philos, we think that love is
worthless. We don’t see that it is philos that leads us to
the highest form of love, agape.
‘Tell me more about agape,’ I said.
Petrus answered that agape cannot really be discussed;
it has to be lived. That afternoon, if possible, he
wanted to show me one of the faces of agape. But in
order for this to happen, the universe, as in the business
of fishing, would have to collaborate so that everything
went well.
‘The messenger helps you, but there is one thing that
is beyond the messenger’s control, beyond his desires,
and beyond you, as well.’
122
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 122
‘What is that?’
‘The divine spark. What we call luck.’
When the sun had begun to set, we resumed our
walking. The Jacobean route passed through some vineyards
and fields that were completely deserted at that
time of day. We crossed the main road – also deserted –
and started again through the woods. In the distance, I
could see the Saint Lorenzo peak, the highest point in
the kingdom of Castile. I had changed a great deal since
I had met Petrus for the first time near Saint-Jean-Piedde-
Port. Brazil and the business deals that I had been
worried about had practically vanished from my mind.
The only important thing for me now was my objective.
I discussed it every night with Astrain, who was becoming
clearer and clearer for me. I was able to see him,
seated at my side, any time I tried. I learned that he had
a nervous tic in his right eye and that he had the habit
of smiling disdainfully every time I repeated something
as evidence that I had understood what he was saying. A
few weeks earlier – during the first days of the pilgrimage
– I had been afraid that I would never complete it.
When we had passed through Roncesvalles, I had been
very disillusioned about everything to do with the journey.
I had wanted to get to Santiago immediately, recover
my sword, and get back to fighting what Petrus called
the good fight.* But right now, with my connection to
123
The Pilgrimage
* I found out later that the term had actually been created by Saint
Paul.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 123
civilization severed, what was most important was the
sun on my head and the possibility that I might experience
agape.
We went down the bank of an arroyo, crossed the
dry bed, and had to struggle to climb up the other side.
An impressive river must have flowed there once, washing
away the bottom in its search for the depths and
secrets of the earth. Now the riverbed was so dry that it
could be crossed on foot. But the river’s major accomplishment,
the valley it had created, was still there, and
it took a major effort to climb out of it. ‘Nothing in this
life endures,’ Petrus had said a few hours before.
‘Petrus, have you ever been in love?’
The question was a spontaneous one, and I was surprised
at my courage. Up until then, I had known only
the bare outline of my guide’s private life.
‘I have known a lot of women, if that is what you
mean. And I have really loved each of them. But I experienced
agape only with two.’
I told him that I had been in love many times but
had been worried about whether I could ever become
serious with anyone. If I had continued that way, it
would have led to a solitary old age, and I had been very
fearful of this.
‘I don’t think you look to love as a means to a comfortable
retirement.’
It was almost nine o’clock before it began to get dark.
The vineyards were behind us, and we were walking
through an arid landscape. I looked around and could
124
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 124
see in the distance a small hermitage in the rocks, similar
to many others we had passed on our pilgrimage. We
walked on for a while, and then, detouring from the
yellow markers, we approached the small building.
When we were close enough, Petrus called out a
name that I didn’t understand, and he stopped to listen
for an answer. We heard nothing. Petrus called again,
but no one answered.
‘Let’s go, anyway,’ he said. And we moved forward.
The hermitage consisted of just four whitewashed
walls. The door was open – or rather, there really was no
door, just a small entry panel, half a meter high, which
hung precariously by one hinge. Within, there was a
stone fireplace and some basins stacked on the floor.
Two of them were filled with wheat and potatoes.
We sat down in the silence. Petrus lit a cigarette and
said we should wait. My legs were hurting, but something
in that hermitage, rather than calming me, made
me feel excited. It would also have frightened me a little
if Petrus had not been there.
‘Where does whoever lives here sleep?’ I asked, just
to break the uneasy silence.
‘There, where you are sitting,’ Petrus said, pointing to
the bare earth. I said something about moving to
another spot, but he told me to stay exactly where I was.
The temperature must have been dropping, because I
began to feel cold.
We waited for almost an hour. Petrus called out the
strange name several more times and then gave up. Just
125
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 125
when I expected us to get up and leave, he began to
speak.
‘Present here is one of the two manifestations of
agape,’ he said, as he stubbed out his third cigarette. ‘It is
not the only one, but it is the purest. Agape is total love.
It is the love that consumes the person who experiences
it. Whoever knows and experiences agape learns that
nothing else in the world is important – just love. This
was the kind of love that Jesus felt for humanity, and it
was so great that it shook the stars and changed the
course of history. His solitary life enabled him to
accomplish things that kings, armies, and empires could
not.
‘During the millennia of Christian civilization,
many individuals have been seized by this love that
consumes. They had so much to give – and their world
demanded so little that they went out into the deserts
and to isolated places, because the love they felt was so
great that it transformed them. They became the hermit
saints that we know today.
‘For you and for me, who experience a different form
of agape, this life may seem terrible. But the love that
consumes makes everything else – absolutely everything
– lose its importance. Those men lived just to be consumed
by their love.’
Petrus told me that a monk named Alfonso lived
there. Petrus had met him on his first pilgrimage to
Compostela, as he was picking fruit to eat. His guide, a
much more enlightened man than he, was a friend of
126
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 126
Alfonso’s, and the three of them had together performed
the Ritual of Agape, the Blue Sphere Exercise.
Petrus said that it had been one of the most important
experiences of his life and that even today when he performed
the exercise, he remembered the hermitage and
Alfonso. There was more emotion in his voice than I
had ever heard from him.
‘Agape is the love that consumes,’ he repeated, as if
that were the phrase that best defined this strange kind
of love. ‘Martin Luther King once said that when Christ
spoke of loving one’s enemies, he was referring to
agape. Because according to him, it was “impossible to
like our enemies, those who were cruel to us, those who
tried to make our day-to-day suffering even worse.” But
agape is much more than liking. It is a feeling that suffuses,
that fills every space in us, and turns our aggression
to dust.
‘You have learned how to be reborn, how to stop
being cruel to yourself, and how to communicate with
your messenger. But everything you do from now on
and every good result that you take with you from the
Road to Santiago will make sense only when you have
also experienced the love that consumes.’
I reminded Petrus that he had said that there were two
forms of agape. And that he probably had not experienced
this first form, since he had not become a hermit.
‘You’re right. You and I and most pilgrims who walk
the Road to Santiago, learning the RAM practices, experience
agape in its other form: enthusiasm.
127
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 127
‘For the ancients, enthusiasm meant trance, or
ecstasy – a connection with God. Enthusiasm is agape
directed at a particular idea or a specific thing. We have
all experienced it. When we love and believe from the
bottom of our heart, we feel ourselves to be stronger
than anyone in the world, and we feel a serenity that is
based on the certainty that nothing can shake our faith.
This unusual strength allows us always to make the right
decision at the right time, and when we achieve our
goal, we are amazed at our own capabilities. Because
when we are involved in the good fight, nothing else is
important; enthusiasm carries us toward our goal.
‘Enthusiasm normally manifests itself with all of its
force during the first years of our lives. At that time, we
still have strong links with the divinity, and we throw
ourselves into our play with our toys with such a will
that dolls take on life and our tin soldiers actually
march. When Jesus said that the kingdom of heaven
belonged to the children, he was referring to agape in
the form of enthusiasm. Children were attracted to him,
not because they understood his miracles, his wisdom,
or his Pharisees and apostles. They went to him in joy,
moved by enthusiasm.’
I told Petrus that on that very afternoon, I had realized
that I was completely absorbed by the Road to
Santiago. Those days and nights in Spain had almost
made me forget about my sword, and they were a
unique experience. Most other things had lost their
importance.
128
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 128
‘This afternoon, we were trying to fish, but the fish
would not bite,’ said Petrus. ‘Normally, we allow enthusiasm
to elude us when we are involved in such mundane
activities, those that have no importance at all in
the overall scale of our existence. We lose our enthusiasm
because of the small and unavoidable defeats we
suffer during the good fight. And since we don’t realize
that enthusiasm is a major strength, able to help us win
the ultimate victory, we let it dribble through our fingers;
we do this without recognizing that we are letting
the true meaning of our lives escape us. We blame the
world for our boredom and for our losses, and we forget
that it was we ourselves who allowed this enchanting
power, which justifies everything, to diminish – the
manifestation of agape – in the form of enthusiasm.’
I remembered the cemetery near the river. That
strange, unusually large portal was a perfect representation
of what had been lost. And beyond it, only the
dead.
As if he had guessed what I was thinking, Petrus
began to talk about something that was similar.
‘A few days ago, you must have been surprised when
I got so angry with that poor waiter who had spilled
coffee on my shorts – shorts that were already filthy
with the dust and dirt of the road. Actually, I was nervous
because I saw in the boy’s eyes that his enthusiasm
was draining away like the blood that runs from wrists
that have been slashed. I saw that boy, so strong and full
of life, beginning to die because inside him, moment by
129
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 129
moment, agape was perishing. I have been around for a
long time, and I have learned to live with these things,
but that lad, with the way he behaved and with all the
good things I felt that he could bring to humanity, left
me shocked and sad. But I know that my anger
wounded him a bit and stemmed the death of agape.
‘In the same vein, when you exorcised that woman’s
dog, you felt agape in its purest form. It was a noble
deed, and it made me proud to be here serving as your
guide. So for the first time in our experience on the
Road, I am going to participate in an exercise with you.’
And Petrus taught me the Ritual of Agape, the Blue
Sphere Exercise.
‘I am going to help you to arouse your enthusiasm,
to create a power that is going to expand like a blue
sphere that encloses the entire planet,’ he said, ‘to show
that I respect you and what you are doing.’
Up until then, Petrus had never expressed an opinion,
either favorable or unfavorable, regarding the way
in which I performed the exercises. He had helped me
to interpret my first contact with the messenger, and he
had rescued me from the trance of the Seed Exercise, but
he had never expressed any interest in the results I had
achieved. More than once I had asked him why he did
not want to know about my feelings, and he had
answered that his only obligation as my guide was to
show me the Road and to teach me the RAM practices. It
was up to me whether I enjoyed the results or found
them to be unpleasant.
130
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 130
When he said that he was going to participate with
me in the exercise, I suddenly felt unworthy of his
praise. I knew my faults, and many times I had doubted
whether he could succeed in guiding me along the
Road. I wanted to say all this to him, but he interrupted
me before I could begin.
‘Don’t be cruel with yourself, or you will not have
learned the lesson I taught you before. Be kind. Accept
the praise that you deserve.’
Tears came to my eyes. Petrus led me outside. The
night was darker than usual. I sat down next to him,
and we began to sing. The melody came from within
me, and he accompanied me with no effort. I began to
clap my hands softly, as I rocked forward and back. My
clapping increased in its intensity, and the music flowed
from me, a psalm of praise to the darkness of the sky,
the deserted plateau, and the lifeless stones around us. I
began to see the saints that I had believed in as a child,
and I could sense that life had gotten away from me
because of my having killed a great deal of my agape.
But now the love that consumes returned, and the saints
smiled from the heavens with the same look and intensity
that I had seen in them when I was small.
I spread my arms so that agape could flow, and a
mysterious current of bright blue light began to wash
through me, cleansing my soul and pardoning my sins.
The light spread first to our surroundings and then
enveloped the world, and I started to weep. I wept
because I was re-experiencing the enthusiasm of my

The Blue Sphere Exercise
Seat yourself comfortably, and relax. Try not to
think about anything.
1. Feel how good it is to be alive. Let your heart
feel free and affectionate; let it rise above and
beyond the details of the problems that may be
bothering you. Begin to sing softly a song from
your childhood. Imagine that your heart is
growing, filling the room – and later your home
– with an intense, shining blue light.
2. When you reach this point, begin to sense the
presence of the saints (or other beings) in which
you placed your faith when you were a child.
Notice that they are present, arriving from
everywhere, smiling and giving you faith and
confidence.
3. Picture the saints approaching you, placing their
hands on your head and wishing you love,
peace, and communion with the world – the
communion of the saints.
132
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 132
4. When this sensation becomes strong, feel that
the blue light is a current that enters you and
leaves you like a shining, flowing river. This blue
light begins to spread through your house, then
through your neighborhood, your city, and your
country; it eventually envelops the world in an
immense blue sphere. This is the manifestation
of the great love that goes beyond the day-today
struggle; it reinforces and invigorates, as it
provides energy and peace.
5. Keep the light spread around the world for as
long as possible. Your heart is open, spreading
love. This phase of the exercise should last for a
minimum of five minutes.
6. Come out of your trance, bit by bit, and return
to reality. The saints will remain near. The blue
light will continue to spread around the world.
This ritual can and should be done with more than
one person. When this is the case, the participants
should hold hands while they do the exercise.
133
The Pilgrimage

childhood; I was once again a child, and nothing in the
world could cause me harm. I felt a presence draw near
and sit down to my right. I imagined that it was my
messenger and that he was the only one who could perceive
the strong blue light that was entering me and
leaving me, spreading throughout the world.
The light was increasing in its intensity, and I felt
that as it enclosed the world, it penetrated into every
door and every back alley, touching every person alive
for at least a fraction of a second.
I felt my hands being held open and extended to the
heavens. At that moment, the flow of the blue light
increased and became so strong that I thought I was
going to pass out. But I was able to keep the light alive
for a few moments more, until I reached the end of the
song I was singing.
I was exhausted but relaxed; I felt free and content
with life and with what I had just done. The hands that
held mine released me. I saw that one of them was
Petrus’s, and I knew in my heart who it was that held
the other.
I opened my eyes, and there at my side was the
monk, Alfonso. He smiled and said, ‘Buenas noches.’ I
smiled, too, and I seized his hand and held it tightly to
my breast. He allowed me to do this for a moment and
then gently removed his hand.
None of us spoke. Some time later, Alfonso arose and
continued his trek along the rocky plateau. I watched
him until he was completely hidden by the darkness.
134
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 134
Petrus broke the silence then, but he made no mention
of Alfonso.
‘Do this exercise whenever you can, and soon agape
will live once again within you. Repeat it before you
embark on any project, during the first days of any trip,
or when you have been greatly affected by something. If
possible, do it with someone you like. It is an exercise
that should be shared.’
So there was the old Petrus: coach, instructor, and
guide, the man about whom I knew so little. The emotion
that he had shown in the hermitage had already
passed away. But when he had touched my hand during
the exercise, I had felt the greatness of his soul.
We returned to the hermitage where we had left our
things.
‘The occupant won’t be back today, so I think we can
sleep here,’ said Petrus, lying down. I unrolled my sleeping
bag, took a swallow of wine, and lay down. I was
exhausted by the love that consumes. But it was a tiredness
that was free of tension, and before I closed my
eyes, I thought of the thin, bearded monk who had sat
beside me and wished me good night. Somewhere out
there he was being consumed by the divine flame.
Maybe that was why the night was so unusually dark –
he had taken all the light of the world into himself.

Death
‘Are you pilgrims?’ asked the old woman who served us
our breakfast. We were in Azofra, a village of small
houses, each with a medieval shield embossed on its
facade. We had filled our canteens at the village fountain
a few moments earlier.
I said that we were, and the woman’s eyes glowed
with respect and pride.
‘When I was a girl, at least one pilgrim passed
through here every day, bound for Compostela. After
the war and after Franco, I don’t know what happened,
but the pilgrimages stopped. Someone must have built
a highway. Nowadays, people only want to travel by
car.’
Petrus said nothing. He had awakened in a bad
mood. I nodded in agreement with the old woman
and pictured a new, paved expressway, climbing the
mountains and running across the valleys, automobiles
with scallop shells painted on their hoods, and
souvenir shops at the gates of the monasteries. I finished
my coffee and bread dipped in olive oil.
Looking at Aymeric Picaud’s guide, I estimated that
we should arrive that afternoon in Santo Domingo de
137
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 137
la Calzada, and I was planning to sleep at the Parador
Nacional.*
I was spending much less money than I had
planned, even eating three meals a day. It was time for
an extravagance, time to give my body the same treatment
I had been giving my stomach.
I had awakened with a strange feeling of being in a
hurry and of wanting to be in Santo Domingo already. I
had experienced the same feeling two days earlier, when
we had walked to the hermitage. Petrus was more
melancholy and quiet than usual; was this the result of
our meeting with Alfonso two days ago? I felt a strong
need to invoke Astrain so that we could discuss the
matter. But I had never summoned him in the morning,
and I was not sure that I could. I decided against it.
We finished our coffee and began to walk. We
passed a medieval house with its coat of arms, the ruins
of an ancient hostel for pilgrims, and a park on the outskirts
of the village. As I once again readied myself to
move out across the countryside, I felt a strong presence
to my left side. I walked on, but Petrus stopped me.
‘There is no use running away,’ he said. ‘Stop and
deal with it.’
I wanted to get away from Petrus and keep going. I
had a disagreeable feeling, a kind of colic near my
138

that have been turned into first-class hotels by the Spanish
government.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 138
stomach. For a few moments, I tried to believe that it
was caused by the bread with olive oil, but I knew that
I had felt it earlier in the day and I could not fool
myself. It was tension – tension and fear.
‘Look behind you.’ Petrus’s voice had an urgency to
it. ‘Look before it’s too late!’
I spun around quickly. To my left was an abandoned
house, its vegetation burned by the sun. An olive tree
raised its twisted branches to the sky. And between the
tree and the house, looking fixedly at me, was a dog.
A black dog, the same dog that I had banished from
the woman’s house a few days earlier.
I forgot all about Petrus and looked squarely into
the dog’s eyes. Something inside me – perhaps it was
the voice of Astrain or of my guardian angel – told me
that if I averted my eyes, the dog would attack me. We
remained that way, staring at each other, for some time.
Here I was, I thought, after having experienced the
wonder of the love that consumes, once again about to
be confronted by the daily and constant threats to my
existence that the world would always present. I wondered
why the animal had followed me for such a great
distance and what it was that he wanted; after all, I was
just a pilgrim in quest of my sword, and I had neither
the desire nor the patience for problems with people or
animals. I tried to say this to him with my eyes –
remembering the monks at the convent who communicated
through their eyes – but the dog did not move. He
continued to stare at me, without emotion, but he
139
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 139
appeared ready to attack should I become distracted or
show fear.
Fear! I could sense that my fear had vanished. I
thought the situation too stupid for fear. My stomach
was knotted up, and I felt like vomiting, but I wasn’t
frightened. If I had been, something told me that my
eyes would have given me away, and the animal would
try to overcome me, as he had before. I did not want to
avert my eyes, even when I sensed that a figure was
approaching along a narrow road to my right.
The figure stopped for an instant and then came
directly toward us. It crossed my line of sight as I stared
at the dog, and this person said something I could not
understand in a feminine voice. Its presence was good –
friendly and positive.
In the fraction of a second during which the image
had crossed my line of sight, my stomach relaxed. I felt
that I had a powerful friend who was there to help me
through this absurd, unnecessary conflict. When the
figure had passed by, the dog lowered his eyes. Then he
jumped, ran behind the abandoned house, and disappeared
from view.
It was only then that my heart began to react. The
tachycardia was so strong that I felt dizzy and faint. As
the scene around me spun, I looked along the road that
Petrus and I had walked only a few minutes earlier,
seeking the figure that had given me the strength to
defeat the dog. It was a nun. Her back was to me, and
she was walking toward Azofra. I could not see her face,
140
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 140
but I remembered her voice, and I guessed that she was
in her early twenties. I looked in the direction from
which she had come: she had appeared from a narrow
path that seemed to lead nowhere.
‘It was she … it was she who helped me,’ I murmured,
as my dizziness grew worse.
‘Don’t start creating fantasies in a world that is
already extraordinary,’ said Petrus, supporting me by the
arm. ‘She comes from a convent in Cañas, three or four
miles from here. You can’t see it from here.’
My heart was still pounding, and I was sure I was
going to be sick. I was too upset to speak or ask for an
explanation. I sat down on the ground, and Petrus
threw some water on my forehead and on the nape of
my neck. I remembered that he had done the same
thing after we had left the woman’s house – but that day
I had cried for joy. Now the sensation was just the opposite.
Petrus let me rest a bit. The water brought me
around, and the nausea began to subside. Things slowly
returned to normal. When I felt restored, Petrus said we
should walk a little, and I obeyed. We walked for about
fifteen minutes, but the exhaustion returned. We sat
down at the foot of a rollo, a medieval column supporting
a cross. Such columns marked a number of stretches
along the Jacobean route.
‘Your fear has hurt you much more than the dog
did,’ said Petrus, as I rested.
I wanted to understand that absurd encounter.
141
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 141
‘In the life on the Road to Santiago, certain things
happen that are beyond our control. When we first met,
I told you that I had read in the gypsy’s eyes the name of
the demon you would have to confront. I was surprised
to learn that the demon was a dog, but I did not say anything
to you about it at the time. Only after we arrived at
that woman’s house – when for the first time, you
showed the love that consumes – did I see your enemy.
‘When you chased away that woman’s dog, you did
not place him anywhere. You didn’t hurl the spirits into
a drove of pigs that was thrown over a precipice, as Jesus
did. You simply chased the dog away. Now his force
wanders along behind you, without a destination.
Before finding your sword, you are going to have to
decide whether you want to be enslaved by that force or
whether you will dominate it.’
My fatigue began to pass. I took a deep breath and
felt the cold stone of the rollo against my back. Petrus
gave me some more water and went on:
‘Cases of obsession occur when people lose their
mastery over the forces of the earth. The gypsy’s curse
had frightened that woman, and her fear had opened a
breach that the messenger of death was then able to
penetrate. This doesn’t always happen, but neither is it
rare. Your confidence and your sense of mastery depend
a great deal on how you react to threats made by others.’
This time it was I who remembered a passage from
the Bible. A verse in the Book of Job says, ‘For the thing
that I greatly feared is come upon me.’
142
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 142
‘A threat leads to nothing if it is not accepted. In
fighting the good fight, you should never forget that.
Just as you should never forget that both attacking and
fleeing are part of the fight. What isn’t a part of the fight
is becoming paralyzed by fear.’
I had not felt fear when the dog was there. This had
surprised me, and I told Petrus about it.
‘I could see that you felt no fear. If you had, the dog
would have attacked you. And without a doubt, he
would have won the fight. Because the dog was not
afraid either. The strangest thing, though, was the arrival
of that nun. When you sensed the presence of something
positive, your imagination concluded that someone
had arrived to help you. And this, your faith, saved
you. Even though it was based on an assumption that
was absolutely false.’
Petrus was right. He laughed at me, and I laughed,
too. We got up to resume our walking. I was already
feeling better.
‘There is one thing you have to know, though,’ said
Petrus as we moved on. ‘The duel with the dog will end
only with a victory for you or for him. He will be back,
and the next time you must try to take the fight through
to the end. If you don’t, his presence will worry you for
the rest of your life.’
In the encounter with the gypsy, Petrus had told me,
he had learned the name of the demon. I asked him
what it was.
‘Legion,’ he answered. ‘Because he is many.’
143

We passed through fields that the farmers were
preparing for sowing. Here and there, some peasants
operated crude water pumps in the centuries-old fight
against the arid soil. Along the edge of the Road to
Santiago, stones had been piled into endless walls, crisscrossing
the fields. I thought about how, in spite of all
the centuries during which that soil had been worked,
stones still surfaced – stones that could break the blade
of a plow, render a horse lame, and leave calluses on the
peasants’ hands. It was a battle every year, a battle that
would never end.
Petrus was quieter than usual, and I realized that he
had said almost nothing since morning. After our conversation
at the medieval rollo, he had been mute, not
answering any of the questions I had asked. I wanted to
know more about the ‘many demons,’ because he had
already explained to me that each person has only one
messenger. But Petrus was not interested in talking
about it, and I decided to wait for a better time.
We climbed a small rise, and from the top we could
see the main tower of the church at Santo Domingo de
la Calzada. I was glad to see it; I began to think about
the magical comfort of the Parador Nacional. From
what I had read about it, the building had been constructed
by Santo Domingo himself as a shelter for pilgrims.
Saint Francis of Assisi had stayed there on his
way to Compostela. Everything about it excited me.
At about seven o’clock that evening, Petrus said we
should stop. I was reminded of Roncesvalles and of the
144
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 144
slow pace we had taken when I had needed some wine
to warm me, and I was afraid that he was preparing
something like that.
‘A messenger would never help you to defeat someone
else. Messengers are neither good nor bad, as I have
already told you, but they have a sense of loyalty among
themselves. Don’t rely on your messenger to help you
defeat the dog.’
Now it was my turn not to want to talk about messengers.
I wanted to get to Santo Domingo.
‘The messengers of people who have died can
occupy the body of someone who is dominated by fear.
That is why, in the case of the dog, he is many.
Messengers were invited in by the woman’s fear – not
just the murdered gypsy’s messenger but all of the many
messengers who wander in space, seeking a way to
establish contact with the forces of the earth.’
He was finally answering my question, but there was
something in the way he spoke that seemed artificial, as
if this were not what he really wanted to say. My
instincts told me to be wary.
‘What do you want, Petrus?’ I asked him, a bit irritated.
My guide did not answer. He walked into the field
toward an ancient, almost leafless tree that stood about
thirty yards from us. It was the only tree visible on the
entire horizon. Since he had not given me the signal to
follow, I stood where I was. And I saw a strange thing
happen: Petrus walked around the tree several times
145
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 145
and said something out loud, while he looked at the
ground. When he had finished, he gestured for me to
come over.
‘Sit here,’ he said. There was a different tone to his
voice, and I couldn’t tell whether it was friendliness or
irritation. ‘Stay here. I will see you tomorrow in Santo
Domingo de la Calzada.’
Before I could say a word, Petrus continued, ‘One of
these days – and I guarantee you that it will not be
today – you are going to have to confront the most
important enemy you will meet on the Road to
Santiago: the dog. When that day comes, you can be
sure that I will be close at hand and will give you the
strength you need to fight him. But today you are going
to confront a different type of enemy, an unreal enemy
that may destroy you or may turn out to be your best
friend: death.
‘Human beings are the only ones in nature who are
aware that they will die. For that reason and only for
that reason, I have a profound respect for the human
race, and I believe that its future is going to be much
better than its present. Even knowing that their days are
numbered and that everything will end when they least
expect it, people make of their lives a battle that is
worthy of a being with eternal life. What people regard
as vanity – leaving great works, having children, acting
in such a way as to prevent one’s name from being forgotten
– I regard as the highest expression of human
dignity.
146
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 146
‘Still, being fragile creatures, humans always try to
hide from themselves the certainty that they will die.
They do not see that it is death itself that motivates
them to do the best things in their lives. They are afraid
to step into the dark, afraid of the unknown, and their
only way of conquering that fear is to ignore the fact
that their days are numbered. They do not see that with
an awareness of death, they would be able to be even
more daring, to go much further in their daily conquests,
because then they would have nothing to lose –
for death is inevitable.’
The possibility of spending the night in Santo
Domingo was looking more and more remote. But now
I was interested in what Petrus was saying. The sun itself
was dying beyond the horizon there in front of us.
‘Death is our constant companion, and it is death that
gives each person’s life its true meaning. But in order to
see the real face of our death, we first have to know all of
the anxieties and terrors that the simple mention of its
name is able to evoke in any human being.’
Petrus sat down beside me under the tree. He said
that he had circled its trunk a few minutes before
because it reminded him of everything that had happened
to him when he had been a pilgrim bound for
Santiago. Then he took from his knapsack two sandwiches
that he had bought at lunchtime.
‘Here, where you are now, there is no danger,’ he
said, giving me the sandwiches. ‘There are no poisonous
snakes, and the dog will return to attack you only after
147
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 147
he has forgotten this morning’s defeat. And there are no
bandits or criminals around here. You are in a spot that
is absolutely safe, with one exception: the danger created
by your own fear.’
Petrus pointed out to me that two days earlier, I had
experienced a sensation that had been as intense and as
violent as death itself – that of the love that consumes.
And that at one point I had vacillated and been afraid. He
said that I had been afraid because I knew nothing about
universal love. He explained to me that although all of us
have some idea of death, we do not see that death is only
another manifestation of agape. I answered that with all
of my years of training in magic, I had practically lost my
fear of death. Actually, I was more frightened by the way
in which I would die than by death itself.
‘Well, then, tonight take a look at the most frightening
way to die.’
And at that point, Petrus taught me the Buried Alive
Exercise.
‘You should do this exercise only once,’ he said. I was
thinking of an exercise from the theater that was quite
similar. ‘It is important that you be as truthful with
yourself as possible and that you be as fearful as necessary
for the exercise to get at the roots of your soul; it
has to strip away the scary mask that hides the gentle
face of your death.’
Petrus stood up, and I saw his silhouette against the
background of the setting sun. From where I was seated,
he seemed to be a gigantic and powerful figure.

The Pilgrimage
The Buried Alive Exercise
Lie down on the floor and relax. Cross your arms
over your chest in the posture of death.
Imagine all of the details of your burial, as if it
were to be carried out tomorrow, the only
difference being that you are being buried alive. As
the situation develops in your mind – the chapel,
the procession to the cemetery, the lowering of the
casket, the worms in the grave – you begin tensing
all of your muscles more and more in a desperate
attempt to escape. But you cannot do so. Keep
trying until you cannot stand it any longer, and
then, using a movement that involves your entire
body, throw aside the confines of the coffin,
breathe deeply, and find yourself free. This
movement will have a greater effect if you scream at
the same time; it should be a scream that emanates
from the depths of your body.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 149
‘Petrus, I have one more question.’
‘What is it?’
‘This morning you were close-mouthed and strange.
You sensed before I did that the dog was going to
appear. How was that possible?’
‘When we both experienced the love that consumes,
we shared in the Absolute. The Absolute shows each of
us who we really are; it is an enormous web of cause
and effect, where every small gesture made by one
person affects the life of someone else. This morning,
that slice of the Absolute was still very much alive in my
soul. I was seeing not only you but everything there is in
the world, unlimited by space or time. Now, the effect is
much weaker and will only return in its full strength the
next time that I do the exercise of the love that consumes.’
I remembered Petrus’s bad mood of that morning. If
what he said was true, the world was going through a
very bad phase.
‘I will be waiting for you there at the Parador,’ he
said, as he prepared to leave. ‘I will leave your name at
the desk.’
I watched him walk away until I could no longer see
him. In the fields to my left, the peasants had finished
their day’s labors and gone home. I decided that I
would do the exercise as soon as darkness had fallen.
I was content. It was the first time I had been completely
alone since I had started along the Strange Road
to Santiago. I stood up and explored my immediate
150
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 150
surroundings, but night was falling fast, and I decided
to go back to the tree before I got lost. Before it became
completely dark, I made a mental estimate of the distance
between the tree and the road. Even in darkness, I
would be able to see the way perfectly well and make
my way to Santo Domingo with just the help of the
frail new moon that had risen in the sky.
Up until that point, I had not been at all frightened;
I felt that it would take a lot of imagination to make me
fearful of any kind of horrible death. But no matter how
long we have lived, when night falls it arouses the
hidden fears that have been there in our souls since we
were children. The darker it grew, the less comfortable I
became.
There I was, alone in the fields; if I were to scream,
no one would even hear me. I remembered that I had
almost passed out completely that morning. Never in
my life had I felt my heart to be so out of control.
And what if I had died? My life would have ended,
obviously. Through my experiences with the Tradition, I
had already communicated with many spirits. I was
absolutely certain that there was a life after death, but it
had never occurred to me to wonder just how the transition
was made. To pass from one dimension to another,
no matter how well prepared one is, must be terrible. If
I had died that morning, for example, I would have
known nothing else about the rest of the Road to
Santiago, about my years of study, about my family’s
grief for me, or about the money hidden in my belt. I
151
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 151
thought about a plant on my desk in Brazil. The plant
would go on, as would other plants, as would the streetcars,
as would the man on the corner who charges more
for his vegetables than anyone else, as would the
woman at directory assistance who provides me with
telephone numbers that are not listed in the book. All
these things – which would have disappeared if I had
died that morning – took on an enormous importance
for me. I realized that those were the things, rather than
the stars or wisdom, that told me I was alive.
The night was quite dark, and on the horizon I
could see the faint lights of the city. I lay down on the
ground and looked at the branches of the tree overhead.
I began to hear strange sounds, sounds of all kinds.
They were the sounds of the nocturnal animals, setting
out on the hunt. Petrus could not know everything; he
was just another human being like me. How was I to
know if his guarantee about the absence of poisonous
snakes was true? And the wolves, those eternal
European wolves – wasn’t it possible that they had
decided to show up there that night, sniffing out my
presence? A louder noise, similar to the breaking of a
branch, frightened me, and my heart once again started
pounding.
I was growing scared. The best thing to do would be
to complete the exercise right away and then head for
the hotel. I began to relax and crossed my arms over my
chest in the posture of death. Something nearby made a
sound. I jumped up immediately.
152
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 152
It was nothing. The night had aroused my greatest
fears. I lay down again, deciding that this time I would
turn any source of fear into a stimulus for the exercise. I
noticed that even though the temperature had fallen
quite a bit, I was perspiring.
I imagined my coffin being closed, and the screws
being turned. I was immobile, but I was alive, and I
wanted to tell my family that I was seeing everything. I
wanted to tell them all that I loved them, but not a
sound came out of my mouth. My father and mother
were weeping, my wife and my friends were gathered
around, but I was completely alone! With all of the
people dear to me standing there, no one was able to
see that I was alive and that I had not yet accomplished
all that I wanted to do in this world. I tried desperately
to open my eyes, to give a sign, to beat on the lid of the
coffin. But I could not move any part of my body.
I felt the coffin being carried toward the grave. I
could hear the sound of the handles grinding against
their fittings, the steps of those in the procession, and
conversations from this side and that. Someone said
that he had a date for dinner later on, and another
observed that I had died early. The smell of flowers all
around me began to suffocate me.
I remembered how I had given up trying to establish
a relationship with two or three women, fearing their
rejection. I remembered also the number of times I had
failed to do what I wanted to do, thinking I could
always do it later. I felt very sorry for myself, not only
153
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 153
because I was about to be buried alive but also because I
had been afraid to live. Why be fearful of saying no to
someone or of leaving something undone when the
most important thing of all was to enjoy life fully?
There I was, trapped in a coffin, and it was already too
late to go back and show the courage I should have had.
There I was, having played the role of my own Judas,
having betrayed myself. There I was, powerless to move
a muscle, screaming for help, while the others were
involved in their lives, worrying about what they were
going to do that night, admiring statues and buildings
that I would never see again. I began to feel how unfair
it was to have to be buried while others continued to
live. I would have felt better if there had been a catastrophe
and all of us had been in the same boat, heading
for the same abyss toward which they were carrying me
now. Help! I tried to cry out. I’m still alive. I haven’t
died. My mind is still functioning!
They placed my coffin at the edge of the grave. They
are going to bury me! My wife is going to forget all
about me; she will marry someone else and spend the
money we have struggled to save for all these years! But
who cares about that. I want to be with her now,
because I’m alive!
I hear sobs, and I feel tears falling from my eyes, too.
If my friends were to open my coffin now, they would
see my tears and save me. But instead all I feel is the
lowering of the coffin into the ground. Suddenly, everything
is dark. A moment ago, there was a ray of light at
154
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 154
the edge of the coffin, but now the darkness is complete.
The grave diggers’ shovels are filling in the grave,
and I’m alive! Buried alive! I sense that the air is being
cut off, and the fragrance of the flowers is awful. I hear
the mourners’ departing footsteps. My terror is total. I’m
not able to do anything; if they go away now, it will
soon be night, and no one will hear me knocking on
the lid of my coffin!
The footsteps fade, nobody hears my screams, and I
am alone in the darkness; the air is heavy, and the smell
of the flowers is driving me crazy. Suddenly, I hear a
sound. It’s the worms, coming to eat me alive. I try with
all my strength to move the parts of my body, but I am
inert. The worms begin to climb over my body. They are
sticky and cold. They creep over my face and crawl into
my shorts. One of them enters through my anus, and
another begins to sneak into a nostril. Help! I’m being
eaten alive, and nobody can hear me; nobody says a
word to me. The worm that entered my nostril has
reached my throat. I feel another invading my ear. I
have to get out! Where is God; why doesn’t he help me?
They are beginning to eat at my throat, and soon I won’t
be able to scream! They are coming into me everywhere:
through my ear, the corner of my mouth, the opening in
my penis. I feel those disgusting, oily things inside me,
and I have to scream; I have to get away! I am shut up in
this cold, dark grave, alone and being eaten alive! The
air is giving out, and the worms are eating me! I have to
move. I have to break out of this coffin! God, help me
155
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 155
gather all of my strength, because I have to escape! I
HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE; I HAVE TO … I’M
GOING TO GET OUT! I’M GOING TO GET OUT!
I DID IT!
The boards of the coffin flew in all directions, the
grave disappeared, and I filled my lungs with the fresh
air of the Road to Santiago. My body was trembling
from head to foot and bathed in perspiration. I moved a
bit and felt that my insides had been twisted around.
But none of this was important: I was alive.
The shaking continued, and I made no effort whatsoever
to control it. A great sense of calm came over me,
and I felt a kind of presence alongside me. I looked over
and saw the face of my death. This was not the death that
I had experienced a few minutes before, the death I had
created with my fears and my imagination; it was my true
death, my friend and counselor, who was never again
going to allow me to act like such a coward. Starting then,
he was going to be of more help to me than Petrus’s guiding
hand and advice. He was not going to allow me to
put off until tomorrow what I should be enjoying today.
He was not going to let me flee from life’s battles, and he
was going to help me fight the good fight. Never again,
ever, was I going to feel ridiculous about doing anything.
Because he was there, saying that when he took me in
hand to travel with me to other worlds, I should leave
behind the greatest sin of all: regret. With the certainty of
his presence and the gentleness of his face, I was sure that
I was going to be able to drink from the fountain of life.
156
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 156
The night held no further secrets or terrors. It was a
joyful night, filled with peace. When the trembling
ceased, I got up and walked to the pumps in the fields. I
washed my shorts and put on a fresh pair from my
knapsack. Then I returned to the tree and ate the two
sandwiches that Petrus had left for me. They seemed
like the most delicious food in the world, because I was
alive and because death frightened me no longer.
I decided to sleep right there. The darkness had
never been so reassuring.

Personal Vices
We were in the middle of a level field of wheat that
stretched all the way to the horizon. The only object
that stood out in the scene was another medieval
column supporting a cross, one of the road markers for
pilgrims. As we approached the column, Petrus stopped,
placed his knapsack on the ground, and knelt down. He
told me to do the same.
‘We are going to say a prayer concerning the only
thing that can defeat you as a pilgrim after you find
your sword: your personal vices. No matter how
much you learn from your Master about how to
handle the sword, one of your hands will always be
your potential enemy. Let us pray that, if you are successful
in finding your sword, you will always wield it
with the hand that does not bring scandal down
upon you.’
It was two o’clock in the afternoon, and there wasn’t
a sound to be heard as Petrus began to pray aloud:
‘Pity us, O Lord, for we are pilgrims on the road to
Compostela, and our being here may be a vice. In your
infinite pity, help us never to turn our knowledge
against ourselves.
159
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 159
‘Have pity on those who pity themselves and who
see themselves as good people treated unfairly by life –
who feel that they do not deserve what has befallen
them. Such people will never be able to fight the good
fight. And pity those who are cruel to themselves and
who see only the evil in their own actions, feeling that
they are to blame for the injustice in the world. Because
neither of these kinds of people know thy law that says,
“But the very hairs of your head are numbered.”
‘Have pity on those who command and those who
serve during long hours of work, and who sacrifice
themselves in exchange merely for a Sunday off, only to
find that there is nowhere to go, and everything is
closed. But also have pity on those who sanctify their
efforts, and who are able to go beyond the bounds of
their own madness, winding up indebted, or nailed to
the cross by their very brothers. Because neither of these
kinds of people know thy law that says, “Be ye therefore
as wise as the serpents and as harmless as the doves.”
‘Have pity on those who may conquer the world but
never join the good fight within themselves. But pity
also those who have won the good fight within themselves,
and now find themselves in the streets and the
bars of life because they were unable to conquer the
world. Because neither of these kinds of people know
thy law that says, “He who heeds my words I will liken
to a wise man who built his house on rock.”
‘Have pity on those who are fearful of taking up a
pen, or a paintbrush, or an instrument, or a tool
160
Paulo Coelho

because they are afraid that someone has already done
so better than they could, and who feel themselves to be
unworthy to enter the marvelous mansion of art. But
have even more pity on those who, having taken up the
pen, or the paintbrush, or the instrument, or the tool,
have turned inspiration into a paltry thing, and yet feel
themselves to be better than others. Neither of these
kinds of people know thy law that says, “For there is
nothing covered that will not be revealed, nor hidden
that will not be known.”
‘Pity those who eat and drink and sate themselves,
but are unhappy and alone in their satiety. But pity even
more those who fast, and who censure and prohibit,
and who thereby see themselves as saints, preaching
your name in the streets. For neither of these types of
people know thy law that says, “If I bear witness of
myself, my witness is not true.”
‘Pity those who fear death, and are unaware of the
many kingdoms through which they have already
passed, and the many deaths they have already suffered,
and who are unhappy because they think that
one day their world will end. But have even more pity
for those who already know their many deaths, and
today think of themselves as immortal. Neither of
these kinds of people know thy law that says, “Except
that one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
God.”
‘Have pity on those who bind themselves with the
silken ties of love, and think of themselves as masters of

others, and who feel envy, and poison themselves, and
who torture themselves because they cannot see that
love and all things change like the wind. But pity even
more those who die of their fear of loving and who
reject love in the name of a greater love that they know
not. Neither of these kinds of people know thy law that
says, “Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him
will never thirst.”
‘Pity those who reduce the cosmos to an explanation,
God to a magic potion, and humanity to beings
with basic needs that must be satisfied, because they
never hear the music of the spheres. But have even more
pity on those who have blind faith, and who in their
laboratories transform mercury into gold, and who are
surrounded by their books about the secrets of the Tarot
and the power of the pyramids. Neither of these kinds
of people know thy law that says, “Whoever does not
receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no
means enter it.”
‘Pity those who see no one but themselves, and for
whom others are a blurred and distant scenario as they
pass through the streets in their limousines and lock
themselves in their air-conditioned penthouse offices,
as they suffer in silence the solitude of power. But pity
even more those who will do anything for anybody, and
are charitable, and seek to win out over evil only
through love. For neither of these kinds of people know
thy law that says, “Let he who has no sword sell his garment
and buy one.”

‘Have pity, Lord, on we who seek out and dare to
take up the sword that you have promised, and who are
a saintly and sinful lot scattered throughout the world.
Because we do not recognize even ourselves, and often
think that we are dressed, but we are nude; we believe
that we have committed a crime, when in reality we
have saved someone’s life. And do not forget in your
pity for all of us that we hold the sword with the hand
of an angel and the hand of a devil, and that they are
both the same hand. Because we are of the world, and
we continue to be of the world, and we have need of
thee. We will always be in need of thy law that says,
“When I sent you without money bag, knapsack, and
sandals, you lacked nothing.”’
Petrus ended his prayer. As silence prevailed, he
gazed out over the field of wheat that surrounded us.

Conquest
We arrived one afternoon at the ruins of an old castle
of the Order of the Knights Templar. We sat down to
rest, and while Petrus smoked his usual cigarette, I
drank a bit of the wine left over from lunch. I studied
the view that surrounded us: a few peasant houses,
the tower of the castle, the undulating fields ready for
sowing. To my right appeared a shepherd, guiding his
flock past the walls of the castle, bound for home. The
sky was red, and the dust raised by the animals
blurred the view, making it look like a dream or a
magic vision. The shepherd waved to us, and we
waved back.
The sheep passed in front of us and continued down
the road. Petrus got to his feet. It was an impressive
scene, and I would like to have stayed, but Petrus said,
‘Let’s go, right away. We’ve got to hurry.’
‘Why?’
‘Because I said so. Don’t you think we have spent
enough time on the Road to Santiago?’
But something told me that his haste had something
to do with the magic scene of the shepherd and his
sheep.
165
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 165
Two days later we were close to some mountains to
the south; their elevation was a relief to the monotony
of the immense wheat fields. The area had some natural
elevations, but it was well punctuated by the yellow
markers that Father Jordi had mentioned. At that point,
Petrus, without explanation, began to stray from the
markers and to plunge more and more in a northerly
direction. When I pointed this out to him, he answered
brusquely, saying that he was the guide and that he
knew where he was leading me.
After half an hour or so along the new path, I began
to hear the sound of tumbling water. All about us were
the sun-drenched fields, and I tried to imagine what the
sound could be. As we continued, the sound grew
louder, and there was no doubt that it was produced by
a waterfall. But I could see neither mountains nor falls
near us.
Then, as we crested a small rise, we were confronted
with one of nature’s most extravagant works: a basin
opened up in the plateau, deep enough to contain a
five-story building, and a stream hurtled to its floor. The
immense crater was bordered by luxuriant vegetation,
completely different in appearance from the flora we
had been passing until then, and it framed the falling
water.
‘Let’s climb down here,’ Petrus said.
We began a descent that put me in mind of Jules
Verne; it was as if we were descending to the center of
the earth. The way was steep and difficult to navigate,
166
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 166
and so as not to fall, we were forced to grasp at thorny
branches and sharp rocks. When I reached the bottom,
my arms and legs were lacerated.
‘Isn’t this beautiful,’ said Petrus, taking no notice of
my discomfort.
I agreed. It was an oasis in the desert. The plant
life and the rainbow formed by the droplets of water
made the basin as beautiful seen from below as from
above.
‘This is where nature really shows its power,’ he said.
‘True,’ I nodded.
‘And it gives us a chance to show our own strength.
Let’s climb the falls,’ said my guide. ‘Through the
water!’
I looked again at the scene. Now I no longer saw it
as an oasis, nor as one of nature’s more sophisticated
caprices. Instead, I was looking at a wall more than fifty
feet high over which the water fell with a deafening
force. The small lagoon formed by the cataract was no
deeper than a man’s height, since the river ran to an
opening that probably took it underground. On the
wall, there were no protrusions that I could make use of
in a climb, and the depth of the pool was not sufficient
to break a fall. I was looking at an absolutely impossible
task.
I thought of an event from five years ago, during a
ritual that had required – like this situation – an
extremely dangerous climb. My Master had given me a
choice as to whether I wanted to continue or not, I was
167
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 167
younger and fascinated by his powers and by the miracles
of the Tradition, so I decided to go on. I needed to
demonstrate my courage and my bravery.
After I had climbed the mountain for nearly an hour
and as I was approaching the most difficult stretch, a
wind of unexpected force arose, and to keep myself
from falling, I had had to cling with all my strength to
the small ledge that supported me. I closed my eyes,
expecting the worst, and dug my nails into the rock. A
minute later, I was surprised to find that someone had
helped me to assume a safer and more comfortable
position. I opened my eyes to see that my Master was
there at my side.
He made some gestures in the air, and the wind suddenly
ceased. With an absolutely mysterious agility, at
times seeming to require an exercise in levitation, he
descended the mountain and told me to do likewise.
I arrived at the base with my legs trembling and
asked him angrily why he hadn’t caused the wind to
abate before it threatened me.
‘Because it was I who ordered the wind to blow,’ he
answered.
‘So it would kill me?’
‘No, in order to save you. It would have been impossible
for you to climb this mountain. When I asked if
you wanted to, I was not testing your courage. I was testing
your wisdom.
‘You made it into an order, when I had not given
one,’ said the Master. ‘If you were able to levitate your-
168
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 168
self, you would not have had a problem. But you
wanted to be brave, when it was enough to have been
intelligent.’
That day, he told me about Magi who had become
insane during the process of illumination and who
could no longer distinguish between their own powers
and those of their disciples. During my lifetime, I have
known some great men in the Tradition. I had gotten to
know three great Masters – including my own – who
were able to dominate material objects in ways that
went far beyond what anyone could imagine. I had witnessed
miracles, exact predictions of the future, and
knowledge of past incarnations. My Master had spoken
of the Falklands War two months before Argentina had
invaded the islands. He had described everything in
detail and had explained the reasons, on an astral level,
for the conflict.
But after that day, I had begun to notice that there
were Magi who, in the Master’s words, had been ‘crazed
by the process of illumination.’ They were individuals
who in almost every way were the equal of their
Masters, even with respect to their powers: I saw one of
them make a seed germinate in twenty minutes of
extreme concentration. But that man and some others
had already led many disciples to madness and despair;
some of those disciples had had to be committed to
mental hospitals, and there was at least one confirmed
case of suicide. Those Masters were on the ‘blacklist’ of
the Tradition, but it was impossible to control them,
169
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 169
and I know that many of them continue their work even
today.
All of this passed through my mind in a fraction of a
second as I looked at the waterfall that seemed impossible
to scale. I thought of the length of time that Petrus
and I had traveled together, of the dog’s attack that had
left me unhurt, of Petrus’s lack of control with the boy
who had waited on us in the restaurant, and of Petrus’s
drinking bout at the wedding celebration. Those events
were all I could remember.
‘Petrus, there’s no way I’m going to climb that waterfall.
And for a very simple reason: it’s impossible.’
He didn’t say a word. He sat down in the grass, and I
did the same. We sat there in silence for fifteen minutes.
His silence disarmed me, and I took the initiative by
beginning to speak.
‘Petrus, I don’t want to climb because I’ll fall. I know
that I’m not going to die, because when I saw the face of
my death, I also saw the day it will happen. But I could
fall and be crippled for the rest of my life.’
‘Paulo, Paulo …’ He looked at me and smiled. ‘You
have completely changed. There is in your voice a bit of
the love that consumes, and your eyes are shining.’
‘Are you going to say that I’m breaking a vow of obedience
that I made before setting out on the Road?’
‘You are not breaking that vow. You are not afraid,
and you are not lazy. Nor should you be thinking that I
have given you a useless order. You don’t want to climb
the falls because you are thinking about the Black

Magi.* You have not broken a vow just because you
have used your decision making ability. A pilgrim is
never prevented from using that ability.’
I looked again at the cataract and again at Petrus. I
was weighing my chances of success in making the
climb, and they didn’t weigh very much.
‘Now, pay attention,’ he continued. ‘I’m going to
climb before you do, without using any gift. And I’m
going to make it. If I succeed just by knowing where to
place my feet, you will have to climb, too. I am nullifying
your freedom to make a decision. If you refuse, after
you have seen me make the climb, then you will be
breaking your vow.’
Petrus began to take off his sneakers. He was at least
ten years older than I, and if he succeeded in the climb,
I would have no further excuse. I studied the waterfall
and felt my stomach seize up.
But he didn’t move. Even though he had taken off
his sneakers, he remained seated in the same place. He
looked at the sky and said, ‘A few kilometers from here,
in 1502, the Virgin appeared to a shepherd. Today is the
feast day commemorating that event – the Feast of the
Virgin of the Road – and I am going to offer my victory

to her. I would advise you to do the same thing. Offer a
victory to her. Don’t offer the pain in your feet or the
cuts on your hands from the rocks. Everybody in the
world offers only pain as penance. There is nothing
wrong with that, but I think she would be happier if,
rather than just pain, people would also offer her their
joys.’
I was in no condition to speak. I still doubted
whether Petrus could climb the wall. I thought the
whole thing was a farce, that I was being drawn in by
the way he spoke and that he would then convince me
to do something I really did not want to do. In the face
of these doubts, I closed my eyes for a moment and
prayed to the Virgin of the Road. I promised that if
Petrus and I were able to climb the wall, I would one
day return to this place.
‘Everything you have learned up to now makes
sense only if it is applied in real life. Don’t forget that I
described the Road to Santiago to you as the road of
the common person; I have said that a thousand
times. On the Road to Santiago and in life itself,
wisdom has value only if it helps us to overcome some
obstacle.

existence of nails, the hammer would be useless if it
only thought, “I can drive those nails with two blows.”
The hammer has to act. To put itself into the hands of
the carpenter and to be used in its proper function.’
172
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 172
I remembered my Master’s words at Itatiaia:
‘Whoever has the sword must constantly put it to the
test, so it doesn’t rust in its scabbard.’
‘The waterfall is the place where you will put into
practice everything you have learned so far,’ said my
guide. ‘There is one thing working in your favor: you
know the day on which you are going to die so that fear
will not paralyze you when you have to decide quickly
where to find a hold. But remember that you are going
to have to work with the water and use it to provide
what you need. Remember that you have to dig a nail
into your thumb if a bad thought takes over. And most
important, that you have to find support for yourself in
the love that consumes during every minute of the
climb, because it is that love which directs and justifies
your every step.’
Petrus fell silent. He took off his shirt and his shorts
and was completely naked. He went into the cold water
of the lagoon, wet himself completely, and spread his
arms to the sky. I could see that he was happy; he was
enjoying the coldness of the water and the rainbows created
by the mist that surrounded us.
‘One more thing,’ he said, before going in under the
falls. ‘This waterfall will teach you how to be a Master. I
am going to make the climb, but there will be a veil of
water between you and me. I will climb without your
being able to see where I place my hands and feet.
‘In the same way, a disciple such as you can never
imitate his guide’s steps. You have your own way of
173
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 173
living your life, of dealing with problems, and of winning.
Teaching is only demonstrating that it is possible.
Learning is making it possible for yourself.’
He said nothing else as he disappeared through the
veil of the cascade and began to climb. I could see only his
outline, as if perceived through frosted glass. But I could
see that he was climbing. Slowly and inexorably he moved
toward the top. The closer he got to the crest, the more
fearful I became, because my time was coming. Finally, the
most terrible moment arrived: the moment when he had
to come up through the falling water without holding to
the sides. The force of the water would surely plunge him
back to the ground. But Petrus’s head emerged there at the
top, and the falling water became his silver mantle. I saw
him for just an instant because, with a rapid motion, he
threw his body upward and secured himself somehow on
top of the plateau, still immersed in the stream of water.
Then, I lost sight of him for some moments.
Finally, Petrus appeared on the bank. He was bathed
in moisture, brilliant in the sunlight, and laughing.
‘Let’s go,’ he yelled, waving his hands. ‘It’s your turn.’
It really was my turn. Either I did it, or I forever
renounced my sword.
I took all of my clothes off and prayed again to the
Virgin of the Road. Then I dived into the lagoon. It was
freezing, and my body went rigid with its impact; but I
then felt a pleasant sensation, a sensation of being
really alive. Without thinking about it, I went straight to
the waterfall.
174
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 174
The weight of the water on my head brought me
back to a sense of reality, the sense that weakens us at
the moment when we most need to have faith in our
powers. I could see that the falls had much more force
than I had thought and that if the water continued to
fall directly onto the top of my head, it would defeat
me, even if I kept both feet firmly planted on the
bottom of the lagoon. I passed through the falls and
stood between the water and the rock, in a space into
which my body just fit, glued to the wall. From there, I
could see that the task was easier than I had thought.
The water did not beat down here, and what had
appeared to me to be a wall with a polished surface was
actually a wall with a great many cavities. I was dumbfounded
to think that I might have renounced my
sword out of fear of the smoothness of the wall when it
turned out to be the kind of rock that I had climbed
dozens of times. I seemed to hear Petrus’s voice saying,
‘Didn’t I tell you? Once a problem is solved, its simplicity
is amazing.’
I began to climb, with my face against the humid
rock. In ten minutes I was almost to the top. Only one
hurdle remained: the final phase, the place where the
water fell over the crest on its trajectory toward the
lagoon. The victory I had won in making the climb
would be worth nothing if I were not able to negotiate
the last stretch that separated me from the open air. This
was where the danger lay, and I had not been able to see
how Petrus had succeeded. I prayed again to the Virgin
175
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 175
of the Road, a Virgin I had never heard of but who was
now the object of all my faith and all my hopes for success.
I began tentatively to put first my hair and then my
entire head up through the water that was rushing over
and past me.
The water covered me completely and blurred my
vision. I began to feel its impact and held firmly to the
rock. I bent my head to create an air pocket that would
allow me to breathe. I trusted completely in my hands
and feet. My hands had, after all, already held an
ancient sword, and my feet had trod the Road to
Santiago. They were my friends, and they were helping
me. But the noise of the water was deafening, and I
began to have trouble breathing. I was determined to
put my head through the flow, and for several seconds
everything went black. I fought with all my strength to
keep my hands and feet anchored to their holds, but the
noise of the water seemed to take me to another place.
It was a mysterious and distant place where nothing
that was happening at that moment was at all important,
and it was a place that I could get to if I had the
strength. In that place, there would no longer be any
need for the superhuman effort it took to keep my
hands and feet holding to the rock; there would be only
rest and peace.
But my hands and feet did not obey this impulse to
surrender. They had resisted a mortal temptation. And
my head began to emerge from the stream as gradually
as it had entered it. I was overcome by a profound love
176
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 176
for my body. It was there, helping me in this crazy
adventure of climbing through a waterfall in search of a
sword.
When my head came completely through the surface,
I saw the bright sun above me and took a deep
breath. This renewed my strength, and as I looked
about, I could see, just a few inches away, the plateau we
had originally walked along – the end of the journey. I
had an impulse to throw myself up and grab for something
to hold, but I could see nothing to grab through
the flowing water. The impulse was strong, but the
moment of victory had not yet come, and I had to control
myself. I was at the most difficult point in the
ascent, with the water beating on my chest, and the
pressure was threatening to throw me back to the place
below that I had dared to leave in pursuit of my dream.
It was no time to be thinking about Masters or
friends, and I could not look to the side to see if Petrus
would be able to save me if I should slip. ‘He has probably
made this climb a million times,’ I thought, ‘and he
knows that here is where I most desperately need help.’
But he had abandoned me. Or maybe he hadn’t abandoned
me, but he was there somewhere behind me, and
I couldn’t turn to look for him without losing my balance.
I had to do it all. I, alone, had to win my victory.
I kept my feet and one hand holding to the rock,
while the other hand let go and sought to become one
with the water. I didn’t want to exert any more effort,
because I was already using all of my strength. My hand,
177
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 177
knowing this, became a fish that gives itself up but
knows where it wants to go. I remembered films from
my childhood in which I had seen salmon jumping
over waterfalls because they had a goal and they simply
had to achieve it.
The arm rose slowly, using the force of the water to
its advantage. It finally burst free, and it took on the task
of finding a hold and deciding the fate of the rest of my
body. Like a salmon in the film, the hand dived into the
water atop the crest, searching for a place, a point that
would support me in the final leap.
The rock had been polished by centuries of running
water. But there must be a handhold: if Petrus had been
able to find one, I could, too. I began to feel great pain,
because now I knew that I was only one step from success;
this is the moment when one’s strength begins to
flag, and one loses confidence in oneself. On a few
occasions in my life I had lost at the last minute – swum
across an ocean and drowned in the surf of regret. But I
was on the Road to Santiago, and that old experience
must not be allowed to repeat itself – I had to win.
My free hand slid along the smooth stone, and the
pressure was becoming stronger and stronger. I felt that
my other limbs could not hold out and that I was going
to begin to cramp. The water was beating on my genitals,
too, and the pain was unbearable. Then my free
hand suddenly found a hold in the rock. It wasn’t a
large one, and it was off to the side of where I wanted to
rise, but it would serve as a support for my other hand
178
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 178
when its turn came. I marked its location mentally, and
my free hand returned to its search for my salvation. A
few inches from the first hold, I found another.
There it was! There was the place that for centuries
had served as a hold for the pilgrims bound for
Santiago. I could see this, and I held on with all my
strength. The other hand came free, was thrown back by
the force of the water, but, in an arc across the sky,
reached and found the handhold. With a quick movement,
my entire body followed the path opened by my
arms, and I threw myself upward.
The biggest and final step had been taken. My whole
body came up through the water, and a moment later the
savage waterfall had become just a trickle of water, hardly
moving. I crawled to the bank and gave in to exhaustion.
The sun fell on my body, warming me, and I told myself
again that I had won, that I was alive as before when I
had stood below in the lagoon. Over the sound of the
water, I heard Petrus’s approaching footsteps.
I wanted to get up and show how happy I was, but
my exhausted body refused.
‘Relax, rest a little,’ he said. ‘Try to breathe slowly.’
I did so and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep. When I
awoke, the sun had moved across the sky, and Petrus,
already fully dressed, handed me my clothes and said
we had to move on.
‘I’m very tired,’ I answered.
‘Don’t worry. I am going to show you how to draw
energy from everything around you.’
179
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 179
And Petrus taught me the RAM Breathing Exercise.
I did the exercise for five minutes and felt better. I
arose, dressed, and grabbed my knapsack.
‘Come here,’ Petrus said. I went to the edge of the
cliff. At my feet, the waterfall rushed by.
‘Looking at it from here, it looks a lot easier than it
did from down there,’ I said.
‘Exactly. And if I had shown it to you from here
before, you would have been misled. You would have
made a poor analysis of your chances.’
I still felt weak, and I repeated the exercise. Shortly,
the entire universe about me fell into harmony with me
and came into my heart. I asked Petrus why he had not
taught me RAM breathing before, since many times I
had felt lazy and tired on the Road to Santiago.
‘Because you never looked like you felt that way,’ he
said, laughing. Then he asked me if I still had any of the
delicious butter cookies I had bought in Astorga.

The RAM Breathing Exercise
Expel all of the air from your lungs, emptying them
as much as you can. Then, inhale slowly as you
raise your arms as high as possible. As you inhale,
concentrate on allowing love, peace, and harmony
with the universe to enter into your body.
Hold the air you have taken in and keep your
arms raised for as long as you can, enjoying the
harmony between your inner sensations and the
outer world. When you reach your limit, exhale all
of the air rapidly, as you say the word, ‘RAM.’
Repeat this process for five minutes each time
you do the exercise.

Madness
For three days we had been making a kind of forced
march. Petrus would wake me before daybreak, and we
would not end our day’s hike before nine in the
evening. The only rest stops granted were for quick
meals, since my guide had abolished our siesta. He gave
the impression that he was keeping to some mysterious
schedule that he hadn’t shared with me.
What’s more, his behavior had changed completely.
At first, I thought it had something to do with my hesitation
at the waterfall, but later I could see that it was
not that. He was irritable with everyone, and he looked
at his watch frequently during the day. I reminded him
that it was he who had told me that we ourselves create
the pace of time.
‘You are becoming wiser every day,’ he answered.
‘Let’s see if you can put all of this wisdom into play
when it is needed.’
On one afternoon, I was so tired from the pace of
our hiking that I simply could not get up. Petrus told
me to take my shirt off and settle my spine along the
trunk of a nearby tree. I held that position for several
minutes and felt much better. He began to explain to
183
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 183
me that vegetation, and especially mature trees, are able
to transmit harmony when one rests one’s nerve centers
against a tree trunk. For hours he discoursed on the
physical, energetic, and spiritual properties of plants.
Since I had already read all of this somewhere, I
didn’t worry about taking notes. But Petrus’s discourse
helped to diminish my feeling that he was irritated with
me. Afterward, I treated his silence with greater respect,
and he, perhaps guessing correctly at my apprehension,
tried to be friendlier whenever his constant bad mood
allowed him to do so.
We arrived one morning at an immense bridge,
totally out of proportion to the modest stream that
coursed below it. It was early on a Sunday morning,
and, since the bars and taverns nearby were all closed,
we sat down there to eat our breakfast.
‘People and nature are equally capricious,’ I said,
trying to start a conversation. ‘We build beautiful
bridges, and then Mother Nature changes the course of
the rivers they cross.’
‘It’s the drought,’ he said. ‘Finish your sandwich,
because we have to move along.’
I decided to ask him why we were in such a hurry.
‘We have been on the Road to Santiago for a long
time. I have already told you that I left a lot of things
unattended in Italy, and I have got to get back.’
I wasn’t convinced. What he was saying might well
be true, but it wasn’t the only issue. When I started to
question what he had said, he changed the subject.
184
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 184
‘What do you know about this bridge?’
‘Nothing,’ I answered. ‘But even with the drought, it’s
too big. I think the river must have changed its course.’
‘As far as that goes, I have no idea,’ he said. ‘But it is
known along the Road to Santiago as the “honorable
passage.” These fields around us were the site of some
bloody battles between the Suevians and the Visigoths,
and later between Alphonse III’s soldiers and the Moors.
Maybe the bridge is oversize to allow all that blood to
run past without flooding the city.’
He was making an attempt at macabre humor. I
didn’t laugh, and he was put off for a moment, but then
he continued, ‘However, it wasn’t the Visigoth hordes or
the triumphant cries of Alphonse III that gave this
bridge its name. It was another story of love and death.
‘During the first centuries of the Road to Santiago,
pilgrims, priests, nobles, and even kings came from all
over Europe to pay homage to the saint. Because of this,
there was also an influx of assailants and robbers.
History has recorded innumerable cases of robbery of
entire caravans of pilgrims and of horrible crimes committed
against lone travelers.’
Just like today, I thought.
‘Because of the crimes, some of the nobility decided
to provide protection for the pilgrims, and each of the
nobles involved took responsibility for protecting one
segment of the Road. But just as rivers change their
course, people’s ideals are subject to alteration. In addition
to frightening the malefactors, the knights began to
185
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 185
compete with each other to determine who was the
strongest and most courageous on the Road. It wasn’t
long before they began to do battle with each other, and
the bandits returned to the Road with impunity.
‘This developed over a long period of time until, in
1434, a noble from the city of Leon fell in love with a
woman. The man was Don Suero de Quiñones; he was
powerful and rich, and he did everything in his power
to win his lady’s hand in marriage. But this woman –
history has forgotten her name – did not even want to
know about his grand passion and rejected his request.’
I was dying of curiosity to know what an unrequited
love had to do with battles among the knights. Petrus
saw that I was interested and said that he would relate
the rest of the story only if I finished my sandwich and
we began to move along.
‘You are just like my mother when I was a child,’ I
said. But I gulped down the last morsel of bread, picked
up my knapsack, and we began to make our way
through the sleepy city.
Petrus continued, ‘Our gentleman, whose pride had
been offended, resolved to do what all men do when
they feel themselves to have been rejected: he began a
private war. He promised himself that he was going to
perform such an important feat that the woman would
never forget his name. For months he sought a noble
idea that would consecrate his spurned love. And then
he heard of the crimes and the battles along the Road to
Santiago. That gave him an idea.
186
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 186
‘He called together ten of his friends, and they set
themselves up in the small city we are passing through
right now. He spread the word by means of the pilgrims
that he was prepared to remain there for thirty days –
and break thirty lances – in order to prove that he was
the strongest and boldest of all the knights of the Road.
He established himself with his banners, his standards,
his pages, and servants, and waited for challengers.’
I could imagine what a picnic that must have been:
roast boar, endless supplies of wine, music, stories, and
battles. A lively picture came to my mind as Petrus
related the rest of the story.
‘The bouts began on the tenth of July with the arrival
of the first challengers. Quiñones and his companions
fought during the day and held huge feasts every night.
The contests were always held on the bridge so that no
one could flee. During one period, so many challengers
came that fires were built along the entire length of the
bridge so that the bouts could go on until dawn. All of
the vanquished knights were required to swear that they
would never again do battle with the others and that
from then on, their only mission would be to protect
the pilgrims going to Compostela.
‘On the ninth of August, the combat ended, and
Don Suero de Quiñones was recognized as the bravest
and most valiant of all the knights of the Road to
Santiago. From that day forward, no one dared to issue
challenges of bravery, and the nobles returned to their
battle against the only enemy in common, the bandits
187
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 187
who assaulted the pilgrims. This epic was later to give
rise to the Military Order of Santiago of the Sword.’
We had crossed the small city. I wanted to go back
and take another look at the ‘honorable passage,’ the
bridge on which all of that had taken place. But Petrus
said that we had to move on.
‘And what happened to Don Quiñones?’ I asked.
‘He went to Santiago de Compostela and placed a
golden necklace at San Tiago’s shrine; even today it
adorns the bust of San Tiago the Lesser.’
‘I was asking whether he wound up marrying the
lady.’
‘Oh, I don’t know,’ Petrus answered. ‘In those days,
history was written only by men. With such a battlefield
close at hand, who was going to be interested in a love
story?’
After telling me the story of Don Suero de
Quiñones, my guide went back to his – now – habitual
silence, and we went along for two more days without a
word. We hardly stopped to rest. On the third day,
though, Petrus began to walk more slowly than usual.
He said that he was a bit tired from the efforts of the
week and that he was too old to continue at that pace.
Again I was sure that he was not telling the truth; his
face, rather than showing fatigue, revealed an intense
preoccupation, as if something very important was
about to occur.
We arrived that afternoon at Foncebadon, a large village
that was completely in ruins. The houses, built of
188
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 188
stone, had slate roofs that had been destroyed by time
and the rotting of the wood that supported them. One
side of the village gave onto a precipice, and in front of
us, behind a mountain peak, was one of the most
important landmarks of the Road to Santiago: the Iron
Cross. This time it was I who was impatient; I wanted to
get to that strange monument, comprised of an
immense wooden base, almost thirty feet tall, topped by
the Iron Cross. The cross had been left there during the
epoch of Caesar’s invasion, in homage to Mercury.
Observing the pagan tradition, the pilgrims along the
Jacobean route were accustomed to leaving stones
brought from elsewhere at the base of the cross. I took
advantage of the abundance of stones in the abandoned
village and picked up a piece of slate.
It was only when I had resolved to move along more
quickly that I saw that Petrus was walking more slowly.
He examined the ruined houses and the fallen tree
trunks and finally decided to sit down in the middle of
one of the plazas where there was a wooden cross.
‘Let’s rest a bit,’ he said.
It was early afternoon, so even if we stayed there for
an hour there would still be time to reach the Iron Cross
before nightfall.
I sat down beside him and gazed at the empty surroundings.
Just as rivers change their course, humans
also change where they live. The houses were solid and
must have lasted for a long time before falling into ruin.
It was a pretty place, with mountains in the distance and
189
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 189
a valley in front of us. I asked myself what could have
happened to cause the people to leave such a place.
‘Do you think that Don Suero de Quiñones was
crazy?’ Petrus asked.
I did not even remember who Don Suero was, and
he had to remind me about the ‘honorable passage.’
‘I don’t think he was crazy,’ I answered. But I wasn’t
sure about my answer.
‘Well, he was, just as Alfonso, the monk that you
met, was. Just as I am, as you can see from the plans
that I make. Or you, seeking your sword. Every one of us
has the flame of madness burning inside, and it is fed
by agape.
‘Crazy doesn’t mean you want to conquer America
or talk to the birds like Saint Francis of Assisi. Even a
vegetable vendor on the street corner can show this
flame of madness if he likes what he is doing. Agape is
grander than our ordinary human concepts, and everyone
thirsts for it.’
Petrus told me that I knew how to invoke agape by
means of the Blue Sphere Exercise. But in order for
agape to flourish, I must not be afraid to change my life.
If I liked what I was doing, very well. But if I did not,
there was always the time for a change. If I allowed
change to occur, I would be transforming myself into a
fertile field and allowing the Creative Imagination to
sow its seeds in me.
‘Everything I have taught you, including agape,
makes sense only if you are satisfied with yourself. If
190
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 190
you are not, then the exercises you have learned are
inevitably going to make you seek change. And if you
do not want all of those exercises to work against you,
you have to allow change to happen.
‘This is the most difficult moment in a person’s life –
when the person witnesses the good fight and is unable
to change and join the battle. When this happens,
knowledge turns against the person who holds it.’
I looked at the deserted city of Foncebadon. Maybe
all of those people, collectively, had felt the need for a
change. I asked whether Petrus had chosen this place
purposely in order to say all of this to me.
‘I don’t know what happened here,’ he answered.
‘Often people have to accept the changes that destiny
forces upon them, but that’s not what I’m talking about.
I am speaking of an act of will, a concrete desire to do
battle against everything that is unsatisfying in one’s
everyday life.
‘On the road of our lives, we always run into problems
that are hard to solve – like, for example, passing
through a waterfall without letting it make us fall. So
you have to allow the Creative Imagination to do its
work. In your case, the waterfall was a life-and-death situation,
and there wasn’t time to consider many options;
agape showed you the only way.
‘But there are problems in our lives that require us to
choose between one way and another. Everyday problems,
like a business decision, the breakup of a relationship,
a social obligation. Each of these small decisions

The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 191
we have to make, throughout our lives, might represent
a choice between life and death. When you leave the
house in the morning on your way to work, you might
choose one means of transportation that will drop you
off safe and sound or another that is going to crash and
kill its passengers. This is a radical example of how a
simple decision may affect us for the rest of our lives.’
I began to think about myself as Petrus spoke. I had
chosen to walk the Road to Santiago in search of my
sword. It was the sword that was most important to me
now, and I needed somehow to find it. I had to make
the right decision.
‘The only way to make the right decision is to know
what the wrong decision is,’ he said after I had mentioned
my concern. ‘You have to examine the other
path, without fear and without being morbid, and then
decide.’
It was then that Petrus taught me the Shadows
Exercise.
‘Your problem is your sword,’ he said after he had
explained the exercise.
I agreed.
‘So do the exercise now. I’m going to take a walk.
When I come back, I know that you will have the right
solution.’
I remembered how much of a hurry Petrus had been
in during the past few days, yet now we were having a
prolonged conversation in this abandoned city. It
seemed to me that he was trying to gain some time so

The Shadows Exercise
Relax completely.
For five minutes, study the shadows of all of the
objects and people around you. Try to identify
exactly which part of the object or person is casting
a shadow.
For the next five minutes, continue to do this,
but at the same time, focus on the problem you are
trying to solve. Look for all of the possible wrong
solutions to the problem.
Finally, spend five more minutes studying the
shadows and thinking about what correct solutions
remain. Eliminate them, one by one, until only the
single correct solution is left.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 193
that he, too, could make a decision regarding something.
This made me excited, and I began to do the exercise.
I did a bit of RAM breathing to put me in harmony
with my surroundings. Then I noted on my watch when
fifteen minutes would have passed, and I began to look
at the shadows all around me – shadows of ruined
houses, stones, wood, and the cross behind me. As I
studied the shadows, I saw that it was difficult to know
exactly what part was casting any given shadow. I had
never noticed this before. Some house beams that were
straight were transformed into shadows with sharp
angles, and an irregular stone cast a shadow with a
smoothly rounded form. I did this for ten minutes. The
exercise was so fascinating that it was not difficult to
concentrate on it. Then I began to think of the wrong
solutions to the problem of finding my sword. Many
ideas came to mind – I thought about taking a bus to
Santiago, and then I thought about phoning my wife
and using some sort of emotional trickery to find out
where she had placed it.
When Petrus returned, I was smiling.
‘So?’ he asked.
‘I found out how Agatha Christie wrote her mystery
novels,’ I joked. ‘She transformed the hunch that was
most wrong into the one that was correct. She must
have known about the Exercise of the Shadows.’
Petrus asked where my sword was.
‘First I’m going to tell you the most erroneous guess
that I came up with as I looked at the shadows: that the
194
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 194
sword is somewhere other than on the Road to
Santiago.’
‘You are a genius. You figured out that we have been
walking all this way in order to find your sword. I
thought they had told you that already in Brazil.’
‘It’s being kept in a safe place that my wife could not
enter,’ I continued. ‘I deduced that it’s in an absolutely
open place but that it has been assimilated so well into
its surroundings that it can’t be seen.’
This time Petrus didn’t smile. I went on:
‘And since the most absurd thing would be that it is
in a place where there are lots of people, it has to be in
some locale that is practically deserted. And most
important, and so that the few people who see it don’t
notice the difference between it and a typical Spanish
sword, it must be in a place where no one knows how
to distinguish between styles of swords.’
‘Do you think it is here?’ he asked.
‘No, it’s not here. The thing that would be most
wrong would be to do this exercise at the place where
my sword is. I discarded that hunch right away. It must
be in a city that is similar to this one, but it cannot be in
an abandoned city, because a sword in an abandoned
city would attract a lot of attention from pilgrims and
passersby. It would wind up as a decoration on the wall
of a bar.’
‘Very good,’ he said, and I could see that he was
proud of me – or of the exercise he had taught me.
‘There’s another thing,’ I said.
195
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 195
‘What’s that?’
‘The place that would be most wrong for the sword
of a Magus to be left is a profane place. It has to be in a
sacred place. Like a church, for example, where no one
would dare to steal it. So, in a church in a small city
near Santiago, visible to everyone but embedded in its
surroundings – that’s where my sword is. Starting now,
I’m going to visit every church on the Road.’
‘You don’t have to,’ he said. ‘When the moment
comes, you will know it.’
I had been right!
‘Listen, Petrus, why did we hurry for such a long
while, when now we’re spending so much time in this
abandoned city?’
‘What would be the answer that is most wrong?’
I glanced at the shadows. He was right. We were
there for some reason.
The sun was hidden behind the mountain, but
nightfall was still some hours away. I was thinking that
the sun was probably shining just then on the Iron
Cross. The cross was only a few hundred yards distant,
and I really wanted to see it. I also wanted to know why
we were waiting around. We had moved along so
rapidly for the entire week, and now it seemed to me
that the only reason for that must have been that we
had to be at this place, on this day, and at this time.
I tried to make conversation to pass the time, but I
could see that Petrus was tense and preoccupied. I had
already seen Petrus in a bad mood many times, but I
196
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 196
could not remember having seen him so tense. And
then I remembered that I had seen him like this once. It
was at breakfast one morning in a small town whose
name I could not remember, just before we had run
into …
I looked to my left. There he was: the dog. The ferocious
dog that had thrown me to the ground, the
coward of a dog that had immediately fled afterward.
Petrus had promised to help me if we ran into him
again, and I turned to my guide. But he had disappeared.
I kept my gaze fixed on the dog’s eyes while I frantically
tried to think of a way to deal with the situation.
Neither of us moved, and I was reminded for a moment
of the duel scenes in the ghost towns of Western movies.
In those films, no one would ever have dreamed of pitting
a man against a dog; it just wouldn’t have worked.
Yet here I was, confronted with a reality that fiction
would have considered too far out.
And there was Legion, so named because he was so
many. Nearby stood a deserted house. If I were to bolt
suddenly, I could climb to its roof, and Legion could
not follow. It seemed absurd that I felt trapped by the
physical presence of a dog and all that his presence
implied.
As I kept my eyes on him, I immediately rejected the
possibility of taking flight. Many times along the Road I
had feared this moment, and now here it was. Before I
could find my sword, I had to meet with the Enemy and
197
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 197
either vanquish him or be defeated by him. I had no
choice but to go up against him. If I fled now, I would
be falling into a trap. It might be that the dog would not
appear again, but I would travel the Road to Santiago de
Compostela gripped by fear and apprehension. Ever
afterward, I would dream about the dog, fearing his
reappearance at any minute and living with dread for
the rest of my life.
As I thought about all this, the dog started toward
me. I stopped thinking immediately and concentrated
only on the battle that was about to begin. Petrus had
left, and I was alone. I was frightened. And as I experienced
that fear, the dog began to move closer, making a
low growling sound. The growl was much more threatening
than a loud bark would have been, and I became
even more terrified. Seeing the weakness in my eyes, the
dog leapt on me.
It was as if a boulder had been thrown at my chest. I
fell to the ground, and he began to bite at me. I remembered
vaguely that I already knew about my death and
that it was not to be like this, but even so, my fear grew,
and I was unable to control it. I began to fight just to
protect my face and throat. An intense pain in my leg
caused me to curl up, and I could see that some flesh
had been torn away. I took my hands from my head and
throat, reaching toward the wound. The dog, seeing this,
began an assault on my face. At that moment, one of my
hands felt a rock at my side. I grasped it and began to
beat on the dog with all my strength.
198
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 198
He backed off a bit, more surprised than hurt, and
I was able to stand. The dog continued to retreat, and
the bloody stone gave me courage. I was paying too
much respect to the strength of my enemy, and this
was a trap. He could not be any stronger than I. He
might be more agile, but he could not be stronger,
because I weighed more and was taller than he. My
fear had lessened, but I wasn’t in control of myself yet,
and with the rock in my hand, I began to shout at the
dog. He withdrew a little further and then suddenly
stopped.
It seemed as if he were reading my mind. In my desperation
I was beginning to feel strong, and I began to
think that it was ridiculous to be fighting a dog. A sense
of power suddenly came to me, and a hot wind began
to blow across the deserted city. Then I began to be tired
of the whole thing; when all was said and done, I had
only to batter him once on the head with the stone, and
I would have won. I wanted it to be over immediately so
that I could dress my wound and put an end to this
absurd business of swords and the Strange Road to
Santiago.
But this was another trap. The dog hurled himself at
me and again pushed me to the ground. This time he
evaded the rock easily, biting my hand and causing me
to let it go. I began to punch him with my hands, but I
was not causing any serious damage. The only thing my
blows accomplished was to keep him from biting me
even more. His sharp claws began to tear my clothing
199
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 199
and my arms, and I saw that it was only a matter of time
before he took charge completely.
All of a sudden, I heard a voice from within me. The
voice said that if the dog established dominion over me,
the fight would be over, and I would be saved: defeated
but alive. My leg was aching, and my entire body stung
from its lacerations. The voice insisted that I give up,
and I recognized whose voice it was: it was Astrain, my
messenger, speaking to me. The dog stopped for a
moment, as if he had heard the same voice, and once
again I felt like leaving the whole thing behind. Astrain
had told me in our conversations that many people fail
to find the sword in their lives, and what difference did
it make? What I wanted to do was go home, be with my
wife, have my children, and work at what I liked.
Enough of these absurdities, fighting with dogs and
climbing waterfalls. This was the second time that this
thought had come to me, but the desire to give up was
even stronger now, and I was certain that I would surrender.
A sound from the streets of the abandoned city
caught the animal’s attention. I looked in the direction
of the sound and saw a shepherd returning from the
fields with his flock. I remembered that I had seen this
scene before, in the ruins of an old castle. When the dog
spotted the sheep, he jumped away from me and made
ready to attack them. This was my salvation.
The shepherd started to yell, and the sheep scattered.
Before the dog got completely away, I decided to engage
200
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 200
him for another moment or two, just to provide enough
time for the animals to flee. I grabbed one of the dog’s
legs. I had the absurd hope that the shepherd might
come to my assistance, and for a moment, my hopes
about the sword and the power of RAM returned.
The dog tried to pull away from me. I was no longer
the enemy; I was a hindrance. What he wanted now was
there in front of him: the sheep. But I continued to
grasp the animal’s leg, awaiting a shepherd who would
not come and suddenly hoping that the sheep would
not take flight.
That is what saved my soul. An immense feeling of
strength infused me. It was no longer the illusion of
power, which causes one to become weary of the battle
and to want to give in. Astrain whispered to me again,
but this time it was something different. He said that I
should always confront the world with the same
weapons that were used to challenge me. And that I
could confront a dog only by transforming myself into a
dog.
This was the same craziness that Petrus had talked
about that day. I began to feel that I was a dog. I bared
my teeth and sounded a low growl, and hatred flowed
from the sounds I made. I saw the frightened face of the
shepherd off to the side and could sense that the sheep
were as terrified of me as they were of the dog.
Legion also saw this and became fearful. Then I
attacked him. It was the first time I had done this in our
fight. I attacked him with my teeth and my nails, trying
201
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 201
to bite the dog in the throat, exactly as I had feared he
would do to me. Inside, I felt only a tremendous desire
for victory. Nothing else was important. I threw myself
on top of the animal and pressed him to the ground. He
fought to free himself from the weight of my body, and
he clawed at my skin, but I too was biting and scratching.
I could sense that if he got out from under me, he
would run away, and I did not want that to happen ever
again. Today I was going to beat him.
The animal began to show fear in his eyes. Now I
was the dog, and he seemed to have been transformed
into a man. My old fear was operating in him now. It
was so strong that he was able to work his way out from
under me, but I corralled him in the basement of one of
the abandoned houses. Behind its low slate wall was the
precipice, and he had no escape. Right there, he was
going to see the face of his death.
I suddenly began to realize that there was something
wrong. My thinking was becoming cloudy, and I
began to see a gypsy’s face with vague images dancing
around it. I had turned myself into Legion. This was
the source of my power. The many devils had abandoned
the poor, frightened dog that a moment from
now was going to fall into an abyss, and now they
were in me. I felt a terrible desire to destroy the
defenseless animal. ‘You are the Prince, and they are
Legion,’ whispered Astrain. But I did not want to be a
Prince, and I heard from a distance the voice of my
Master. He said insistently that there was a sword to be
202
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 202
won. I had to resist for one more minute. I should not
kill that dog.
I looked over at the shepherd. His look confirmed
what I was thinking. He, too, was now more frightened
of me than of the dog.
I began to feel dizzy, and the scene began to spin. I
could not allow myself to faint. If I fainted now, Legion
would have won. I had to find a solution. I was no
longer fighting against an animal but against the force
that possessed me. I felt my legs beginning to weaken,
and I leaned against a wall, but it gave way under my
weight. Among the stones and bits of wood, I fell with
my face in the dirt.
The earth. Legion was the earth and the fruits of the
earth – the good fruits of the earth and the bad, but of
the earth. His house was in the earth, and there he ruled
the earth or was ruled by it. Agape exploded within me,
and I dug my nails into the earth. I screamed, and the
scream was the same as I had heard the first time the
dog and I had met. I felt Legion pass through my body
and descend into the earth. Within me was agape, and
Legion did not want to be eaten by the love that consumes.
This was my will, the will that had made me
fight with my remaining strength against fainting; it was
the will of agape residing in my soul and resisting. My
entire body trembled.
Legion plummeted into the earth. I began to vomit,
but I felt that it was agape, growing and exiting through
all of my pores. My body continued to tremble, and a
203
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 203
long time later I sensed that Legion had returned to his
realm.
I could feel his last vestige pass out through my fingers.
I sat on the ground, wounded and exhausted, and
looked at the absurd scene in front of me: a dog, bleeding
and waving his tail, and a terrified shepherd staring
at me.
‘It must have been something you ate,’ said the shepherd,
not wanting to believe what he had seen. ‘But now
that you’ve vomited, you will feel better.’
I nodded my head. He thanked me for having controlled
‘my’ dog and went his way down the road with
his sheep.
Petrus appeared but said nothing. He tore off a strip
of his shirt and made a tourniquet for my leg, which
was bleeding badly. He told me to check the rest of my
body, and I replied that there was nothing serious.
‘You look awful,’ he said, smiling. His good mood
seemed to have returned. ‘We can’t visit the Iron Cross
with you looking like that. There are probably tourists
there, and they would be frightened.’
I didn’t pay any attention to him. I got up, brushed
off the dust, and saw that I could walk. Petrus suggested
that I do the RAM Breathing Exercise, and he picked up
my knapsack. I did the exercise and returned once again
to a sense of harmony with the world. In half an hour, I
would be at the Iron Cross.
And someday, Foncebadon was going to rise from its
ruins. Legion had left a lot of power there.

Command and Obedience
Petrus was carrying me as we arrived at the Iron Cross;
my leg wound prevented me from walking. When he
realized the extent of the damage done by the dog, he
decided that I should rest until the wound had healed
enough for us to continue along the Strange Road to
Santiago. Nearby there was a village that provided shelter
for pilgrims who were overtaken by nightfall before
crossing the mountains, and Petrus found us two rooms
in the home of a blacksmith.
My haven had a small veranda, an architectural feature
we hadn’t seen previously along the Road. From it,
I could see the range of mountains we would have to
cross sooner or later in order to reach Santiago. I fell
into bed and slept until the following day; although I
felt slightly feverish when I awoke, I also felt better.
Petrus brought some water from the fountain that
the villagers called ‘the bottomless well,’ and he bathed
my wounds. In the afternoon, he came to my room
with an old woman who lived nearby. They placed several
different types of herbs on the wounds and lacerations,
and the woman made me drink some bitter tea.
Petrus insisted that I lick the wounds until they had
205
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 205
completely closed. I can still remember the sweet, metallic
flavor of my blood; it nauseated me, but my guide
told me that my saliva was a powerful disinfectant.
The fever returned during the second day. Petrus and
the old woman again plied me with the tea, and they
again put the herbs on my wounds. But the fever,
although it was not high, continued. My guide decided
to go to a military base nearby to see if he could get
some bandages, since there was no place in the entire
village where gauze or adhesive tape was available.
Several hours later, Petrus returned with the bandages.
He was accompanied by a young medical officer,
who insisted on knowing where the animal was that
had attacked me.
‘From the type of bite you have, the animal was
rabid,’ he told me.
‘No, no,’ I said. ‘I was just playing with him, and it
got out of control. I have known the dog for a long
time.’
The medical officer was not convinced. He insisted
that I take an antirabies vaccine, and I was forced to let
him administer at least one dose or else I would have
been transferred to the base hospital. Afterward, he
again asked where the animal was.
‘In Foncebadon,’ I answered.
‘Foncebadon is a city in ruins. There are no dogs
there,’ he said, with an air of having found out the lie.
I began to moan as though I were in pain, and
Petrus led the young officer out of the room. But he left
206
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 206
everything we would need: clean bandages, adhesive
tape, and a styptic compound.
Petrus and the old woman refused to use the compound.
They bound the wounds with gauze and herbs
instead. This made me happy, because it meant that I
would no longer have to lick the places where the dog
had bitten me. During the night, they both knelt at my
bedside and, with their hands placed on my body,
prayed aloud for me. I asked Petrus what he was doing,
and he made a vague reference to the divine graces and
the Road to Rome. I wanted him to tell me more, but he
said nothing else.
Two days later, I had recuperated completely. That
morning, I looked out my window and saw some soldiers
conducting a search of the houses nearby and of
the hills around the village. I asked one of them what
was happening.
‘There is a rabid dog somewhere around here,’ he
answered.
That afternoon, the blacksmith in whose rooms
we were staying came to me and asked that I leave
the town as soon as I was able to travel. The story
had spread among the townspeople, and they were
fearful that I would become rabid and transmit the
disease to others. Petrus and the old woman began
to argue with the blacksmith, but he was adamant.
At one point, he even asserted that he had seen a
trickle of foam at the comer of my mouth while I
was sleeping.
207
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 207
There was no way to convince him that all of us
drool a bit in our sleep. That night, Petrus and the
woman prayed incessantly over me, and the next day,
limping somewhat, I was once again on the Strange
Road to Santiago.
I asked Petrus if he had been worried about my
recovery.
‘There is an understanding about the Road to
Santiago that I have not told you about before,’ he said.
‘Once a pilgrimage has begun, the only acceptable
excuse for interrupting it is illness. If you had not been
able to recover from your wounds and your fever had
continued, it would have been an omen, telling us that
our pilgrimage had to end there.’
But he added, with some pride, that his prayers had
been answered. And I was certain that the outcome had
been as important for him as it was for me.
The Road was downhill now, and Petrus pointed out
that it would be that way for the next two days. We had
returned to our usual schedule, with a siesta every afternoon
at the time when the sun was fiercest. Because of
my bandages, Petrus carried my knapsack. We were no
longer in a hurry: the encounter we had been rushing
toward was over.
My disposition improved with every hour, and I was
quite proud of myself; I had climbed a waterfall and
defeated the demon of the Road. All that remained was
the most important task: to find my sword. I mentioned
this to Petrus.
208
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 208
‘Your victory was beautiful, but you failed in the
most critical sense,’ he said, throwing a deluge of cold
water over me.
‘What do you mean?’
‘Knowing the right moment for the encounter. I had
to hurry us along, setting a pace that was demanding,
and the only thing you could think about was that we
were after your sword. What good is a sword if you
don’t know where you are going to run into your
enemy?’
‘The sword is the instrument of my power,’ I
answered.
‘You are too preoccupied with your power,’ he said.
‘The waterfall, the RAM practices, the dialogues with
your messenger – they all made you forget that there
was your enemy to vanquish. And forget that you had
an impending encounter with him. Before your hand
can wield the sword, you have to discover where your
enemy is and how to deal with him. The sword only
strikes a blow, but the hand is already victorious or
defeated before the blow is delivered.
‘You defeated Legion without your sword. There is a
secret in this search, and it is a secret you have not yet
learned. If you do not do so, you will never find what
you are looking for.’
I didn’t answer him. Every time I began to feel that I
was getting close to my objective, Petrus insisted on
reminding me that I was just a simple pilgrim and that
there was always something else I needed in order to
209
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 209
find what I was looking for. The happiness I had been
feeling a few minutes before we began the conversation
now disappeared completely.
Once again I was starting out on the Strange Road to
Santiago, and I was totally discouraged. Along the same
Road that I was walking, millions of souls had passed
during the past twelve centuries, going to and returning
from Santiago de Compostela. In their case, getting to
where they had wanted to go had only been a matter of
time. In my case, the traps set by the Tradition were forever
placing another obstacle in my path and creating
new tests for me.
I told Petrus that I was growing tired, and we sat
down in the shade. There were huge wooden crosses
along the side of the road. Petrus put the two knapsacks
on the ground and spoke again: ‘Our enemy always represents
our weaker side. This may be a fear of physical
pain, but it may also be a premature sense of victory or
the desire to abandon the fight because we define it as
not being worth the effort.
‘Our enemy joins the battle only because he knows
that he can hurt us – and hurt us in exactly the spot
where our pride tells us that we are most invincible.
During the fight, we always try to protect our weak spot,
so the enemy strikes at the unguarded side – the side in
which we have the most confidence. And we wind up
defeated because we allow what should never be
allowed: we let the enemy choose how the battle will be
waged.’
210
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 210
Everything Petrus was describing had happened
during my fight with the dog. Yet I told him that I could
not accept the idea that I had enemies and that I had to
do battle with them. I said that when Petrus had spoken
of the good fight, I had thought that he had been talking
about fighting for achievements in one’s life.
‘That’s right,’ he said. ‘But that is not all the good
fight is. Going to war is not a sin. It is an act of love. The
enemy develops us and sharpens us, as the dog did with
you.’
‘OK, I understand that. But let’s get back to what we
were talking about before. Why is it that you never seem
to be satisfied with what I do? I have the impression
that you always think I am going about things the
wrong way. And weren’t you about to tell me the secret
of my sword?’
Petrus said that this was something I should have
learned before beginning the pilgrimage. And he went
on about the enemy.
‘Our enemy is part of agape, there to test our grip, our
will, and our handling of the sword. He was placed in
our lives – and we in his – with a purpose. And that purpose
has to be met. So to flee from the battle is the worst
thing that could happen. It is worse than losing the fight,
because we can always learn something from defeat; if we
flee, all we do is declare that our enemy has won.’
I said I was surprised to hear him say that; it amazed
me to hear a man who seemed to feel so close to Jesus
talk about violence in this way.
211

The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 211
‘Think about why Jesus needed Judas so,’ he said. ‘He
had to choose an enemy, or his battle here on earth
could not have been glorified.’
The wooden crosses along the road testified to how
that glory had been achieved: with blood, treason, and
desertion. I got up and said I was ready to move on.
As we walked, I asked him what, in a battle situation,
was a person’s greatest source of strength in trying
to defeat the enemy.
‘Your present. We defend ourselves best through
what we are doing right now, because that is where
agape and the will to win, through enthusiasm, are.
‘And there’s another thing I want to make very clear:
the enemy rarely represents evil. He is an everyday presence,
and it is he that keeps our sword from rusting in
its scabbard.’
I remembered that once, when we were building a
summer house, my wife had decided suddenly to
change the location of one of the rooms. It had been my
job to give this disagreeable news to the builder. I had
called him, a man of about seventy years of age, and
told him what I wanted. He had looked at the plan,
thought about it, and came up with an even better solution,
using a wall that he had already begun to raise. My
wife had loved the idea.
Maybe it was this that Petrus was trying to describe
in a more complicated way: that we have to use the
thrust of what we are doing right now to defeat the
enemy.

I told him the story about the builder.
‘Life always teaches us more than the Road to
Santiago does,’ he answered. ‘But we don’t have much
faith in what life teaches us.’
There were crosses all along this part of the Jacobean
route. They were made of such massive, heavy wood
that the pilgrim who put them there must have had an
almost superhuman strength. A cross had been placed
every thirty meters for as far as I could see. I asked
Petrus what their significance was.
‘An ancient and obsolete instrument of torture,’ he
said.
‘But why are they here?’
‘They must have been some kind of pledge. How
should I know?’
We stopped in front of one of them that had toppled
over.
‘Maybe the wood rotted,’ I said.
‘It’s the same wood as all the others. And none of
the others rotted.’
‘Then it must not have been sunk into the earth
firmly enough.’
Petrus stopped and looked around. He put his knapsack
on the ground and sat down. We had stopped to
rest only a few minutes before, so I couldn’t understand
what he was doing. Instinctively, I looked around,
expecting to see the dog.
‘You defeated the dog,’ he said, knowing what I was
thinking. ‘Don’t worry about the ghosts of the dead.’
213

‘Well, then, why are we stopping?’
Petrus made a gesture that told me to be quiet, and I
did not say anything for several minutes. I felt the old
fear of the dog and decided to remain standing, hoping
Petrus would say something.
‘What do you hear?’ he asked me.
‘Nothing. The silence.’
‘We are not smart enough to be able to listen to the
silence! We are just human beings, and we don’t even
know how to listen to our own ramblings. You have
never asked me how I knew that Legion was about to
arrive. Now I will tell you how: by listening. The sound
began many days before, when we were still in Astorga.
Starting then, I began to move along more quickly,
because all the indications were that we were going to
meet up with him in Foncebadon. You heard the same
sound as I, but you were not listening.
‘Everything is contained in sounds – the past, the present,
and the future. The person who does not know how
to listen will never hear the advice that life offers us all
the time. And only the person who listens to the sounds
of the moment is able to make the right decisions.’
Petrus bade me sit down and forget about the dog.
He said that he was going to teach me one of the easiest
and most important practices of the Road to Santiago.
And he explained the Listening Exercise to me.
‘Do it right now,’ he said.
I began to perform the exercise. I heard the wind
and a woman’s voice far in the distance, and at one

The Listening Exercise
Relax. Close your eyes.
Try for several minutes to concentrate on all of
the sounds you hear in your surroundings, as if you
were hearing an orchestra playing its instruments.
Little by little, try to separate each sound from
the others. Concentrate on each one, as if it were
the only instrument playing. Try to eliminate the
other sounds from your awareness.
When you do this exercise every day, you will
begin to hear voices. First, you will think that they
are imaginary. Later, you will discover that they are
voices of people from your past, present, and future,
all of them participating with you in the
remembrance of time.
This exercise should be performed only when
you already know the voice of your messenger.
Do this exercise for ten minutes at a time.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 215
point I sensed that a branch was being broken. It was
not a difficult exercise, and I was fascinated by its simplicity.
I put my ear to the ground and began to listen to
the muted sounds of the earth. After a few moments, I
began to separate the sounds from each other: the
sound of the leaves rustling, the sound of the voice in
the distance, and the noise of the beating of the wings
of birds. An animal grunted, but I could not identify
what kind of beast it was. The fifteen minutes I spent on
the exercise flew by.
‘After a while, you will see that this exercise will help
you to make the right decision,’ Petrus said, without
asking me what I had heard. ‘Agape speaks to you
through the Blue Sphere Exercise, but it also speaks to
you through your sight, your sense of touch, through
scents, and your heart, and your hearing. A week from
now, at the most, you will begin to hear voices. At first,
they will be timid, but before long they are going to
begin to tell you things that are important. Be careful,
though, with your messenger. He is going to try to confuse
you. However, you already know the sound of his
voice, so he will no longer be a threat.’
Petrus asked if I had heard the joyful call of an
enemy, or an invitation offered by a woman, or the
secret of my sword.
‘I just heard the voice of a woman in the distance,’ I
said. ‘But it was a farmer’s wife calling to her child.’
‘Well, look at that cross there, and see if you can
raise it with your thoughts.’
216
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 216
I asked him what such an exercise would mean.
‘It means having faith in your thoughts,’ he
responded.
I sat down on the ground in a yoga position. I was
certain that after everything I had accomplished with
the dog and with the waterfall, I was going to be able
to do this, too. I fixated on the cross. I imagined
myself leaving my body, grasping the cross, and raising
it using my astral body. On the road of the Tradition, I
had already performed some of these small ‘miracles.’ I
had been able to shatter glasses and porcelain statues
and to move objects along the surface of a table. It was
an easy magic trick, and even though it did not signify
any great power, it was useful in winning over nonbelievers.
I had never tried it, though, with an object the
size and weight of the cross. But if Petrus had commanded
that I do so, I felt I would know how to make
it happen.
For half an hour I tried everything I could. I used
astral displacement and suggestion. I remembered the
power my Master had over the force of gravity, and I
tried to repeat the words that he always used on such
occasions. Nothing happened. I was concentrating completely,
but the cross did not budge. I invoked Astrain,
and he appeared between the columns of fire. But when
I spoke to him about the cross, he said that he detested
crosses.
Petrus finally shook me to bring me out of my
trance.
217
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 217
‘Come on, this is becoming irritating,’ he said. ‘Since
you can’t do it by thinking, put the cross upright with
your hands.’
‘With my hands?’
‘Do it!’
I was startled. Suddenly the man in front of me had
become nasty, very different from the person who had
cared for my wounds. I didn’t know what to say or do.
‘Do it!’ he repeated. ‘I am ordering you to do it!’
There I was, with my arms and hands wrapped in
bandages because of the dog’s attack. I had just been
through the Listening Exercise, but I couldn’t believe
what I was hearing from Petrus. Without saying anything,
I showed him my bandages. But he continued to
look coldly at me, not changing his expression in the
least. He expected me to obey him. The guide and
friend who had accompanied me all this time, who had
taught me the RAM practices and told me the beautiful
stories about the Road to Santiago, seemed no longer to
be there. In his place I saw a man who regarded me as a
slave and had ordered me to do something that was
stupid.
‘What are you waiting for?’ he asked.
I remembered the waterfall experience. I recalled
that on that day I had had some doubts about Petrus
but that then he had been generous with me. He had
demonstrated his love and had kept me from giving up
on my sword. I could not understand how the same
person who had been so kind could be so harsh now.
218
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 218
He suddenly seemed to represent the very thing that the
human race was trying to put behind it – the oppression
of one person by another.
‘Petrus, I …’
‘Do it, or the Road to Santiago ends right here!’
I was scared again. At that moment, I was more
frightened than I had been at the waterfall; I was more
fearful of him than of the dog that had terrorized me for
so long. I prayed that a signal would come to me from
somewhere in our surroundings, that I would see or
hear something that would explain his senseless command.
But we were engulfed in silence. I either had to
obey Petrus or forget about the sword. Once again, I
raised my bandaged arms, but he sat down on the
ground, waiting for me to carry out his orders.
So I decided to obey him.
I went to the cross and tried to budge it with my foot
to test its weight. It hardly moved. Even if my hands had
been in good shape, I would have had a very difficult
time trying to lift it, and I knew that with my hands
bound as they were, the task would be almost impossible.
But I was going to comply. I was going to die in the
attempt, if that was necessary; I was going to sweat
blood, as Jesus had when he had had to carry the same
kind of burden. But Petrus was going to perceive the
seriousness of my effort, and perhaps that would touch
him in some way and he would free me from the test.
The cross had broken at its base, but it was still
attached to it. I had no knife with which to cut through
219
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 219
the fibers. Forgetting about my pain, I put my arms
around the cross and tried to wrench it from the shattered
base, without using my hands. The wood abraded
the lacerations on my arms, and I cried out in pain. I
looked at Petrus, and he was completely impassive. I
resolved that I would not cry out again. From that
moment on, I would stifle any such demonstration.
I knew that my immediate problem was not to move
the cross but to free it from its base. Afterward, I would
have to dig a hole and push the cross into it. I found a
stone with an edge to it and, ignoring the pain, began to
pound at the wooden fibers.
The pain was terrible and grew worse with every
blow, and the fibers were parting very slowly. I had to
give up that approach right away, before my wounds
reopened and the whole effort became impossible. I
decided to work at it more slowly so that I could accomplish
the task without succumbing to the pain. I took
off my shirt, wrapped it around my hand, and went
back to the job with this additional protection. The idea
was a good one: the first fiber parted, and then the
second. The stone was losing its edge, so I looked
around for another. Each time I paused, I had the feeling
that I would not be able to start again. I gathered
several sharp stones and used them, one after the other,
so that the pain in the hand I was working with was
bearable. Almost all of the fibers had been cut, but the
main one still held firm. The pain in my hand was
increasing, and abandoning the idea of working slowly,
220
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 220
I began to strike at the wood frantically. I knew that I
was coming close to the point where the pain would
make it impossible to continue. It was just a matter of
time until this happened, and I had to make good use
of that time. I was sawing and pounding now, and
something sticky between my skin and the bandages
was making the work even more difficult. It is probably
blood, I thought, but then I put it out of my mind. I
gritted my teeth, struck harder at the fiber, and it
seemed about to break. I was so excited that I stood up
and delivered a blow with all my strength to the wood
that was causing all my suffering.
With a groan, the cross fell to the side, freed from its
base.
My joy lasted only for a few moments. My hand was
throbbing violently, and I had only begun the job. I
looked over at Petrus and saw that he was sleeping. I
stood there for a time, trying to figure out some way of
fooling him, of putting the cross upright without his
noticing it.
But that was exactly what Petrus wanted: that I raise
the cross. And there was no way to deceive him, because
the task depended solely on me.
I looked at the ground – the dry, yellow earth. Once
again, stones would be my only tools. I could not work
anymore with my right hand because it hurt too much,
and there was that sticky substance under the bandage
that worried me. I carefully unwrapped the shirt from
the bandages; blood was staining the gauze – and this
221
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 221
was a wound that had almost healed. Petrus was a monster!
I found a different kind of stone, one that was heavier
and more resistant. Rolling the shirt around my left
hand, I began to beat at the earth, trying to dig a hole at
the foot of the cross. My initial progress was good, but it
was soon slowed by the hardness and dryness of the
ground. I kept digging, but the hole seemed to stay the
same depth. I decided that I would not make the hole
very wide so that the cross would fit into it without
wobbling, but this made it more difficult to remove the
dirt from the excavation. My right hand had stopped
hurting as much as it had, but the coagulated blood
made me nauseated and anxious. I was not used to
working with my left hand, and the stone kept slipping
from my grip.
I dug forever! Every time the stone beat on the
ground, and every time I put my hand into the hole to
remove some dirt, I thought of Petrus. I looked over at
him, dozing peacefully, and I hated him from the
bottom of my heart. Neither the noise nor my hatred
appeared to disturb him. ‘He must have his reasons,’ I
said to myself, but I could not understand the debasement
and humiliation he was inflicting on me. I saw his
face in the earth I was pounding, and the rage I was feeling
helped me to dig the hole deeper. Again, it was just
a matter of time: sooner or later I was going to win.
As I thought about this, the rock hit something solid
and sprang back. This was my worst fear. After all that
222
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 222
work, I had run into a stone that was too big for me to
continue.
I stood up, wiping the sweat from my face, and
began to think. I didn’t have enough strength to move
the cross to another place. I couldn’t start again from
the beginning because my left hand, now that I had
stopped, felt dead. This was worse than pain, and it
really scared me. I looked at my fingers, and I was able
to move them, but instinct told me that I shouldn’t
punish the hand anymore.
I looked at the hole. It wasn’t deep enough to hold
the cross erect.
‘The wrong answer will indicate the right one.’ I
remembered the Shadows Exercise and what Petrus had
said then. It was also then that he had told me that the
RAM practices would make sense only if I could apply
them in my daily life. Even in a situation as absurd as
the present one, the RAM practices should be of some
use.
‘The wrong answer will indicate the right one.’ The
impossible solution would be to try to drag the cross to
a different place; I no longer had the strength to do that.
It was also impossible to try digging deeper into the
ground.
So if the impossible answer was to go deeper into
the earth, the possible answer was to raise the earth. But
how?
And suddenly, all of my love for Petrus was restored.
He was right. I could raise the earth!
223
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 223
I began to collect all the stones nearby and placed
them around the hole, mixing them with the earth I had
removed. With great effort, I lifted the foot of the cross a
little and supported it with stones to raise it higher off
the ground. In half an hour, the ground was higher, and
the hole was deep enough.
Now I just had to get the cross into the hole. It was
the last step, and I had to make it work. One of my
hands was numb, and the other was giving me a great
deal of pain. My arms were wrapped in bandages. But
my back was all right; it had just a few scratches. If I
could lie down beneath the cross and raise it bit by bit, I
would be able to slide it into the hole.
I stretched out on the ground, feeling the dust in my
nose and eyes. With the hand that was numb, I raised the
cross a fraction and slid underneath it. Carefully, I
adjusted my position so that its trunk rested squarely on
my back. I felt its weight and knew that it would be heavy
to lift but not impossible. I thought about the Seed
Exercise, and very slowly I squirmed into a fetal position,
balancing the cross on my back. Several times I thought it
was going to fall, but I was working slowly; I was able to
sense the direction it might take and correct for it by
repositioning my body. I finally achieved the position I
wanted, with my knees in front of me and the cross balanced.
For a moment, the foot of the cross shook on the
pile of stones, but it did not fall out of place.
‘It’s a good thing I don’t have to save the universe,’ I
thought, oppressed by the weight of the cross and every-
224
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 224
thing it represented. A profoundly religious feeling took
possession of me. I remembered that another person
had carried the cross on his shoulders and that his damaged
hands had not been able to free themselves from
the wood or the pain as mine could. This religious feeling
was loaded down with pain, but I forgot about it
immediately because the cross began to shake again.
Then, slowly raising myself up, I began a rebirth. I
couldn’t look behind me, and sound was my only
means of orientation. But just a while ago I had learned
how to listen to the world, as if Petrus had guessed that
I was going to need this kind of knowledge. I felt the
weight of the cross and sensed that the stones were
accommodating each other. The cross rose bit by bit, as
if to help me in this test. It was as if the cross, itself,
wanted to return to its position, framing that section of
the Road to Santiago.
One final push was all that was needed. If I could
get into a seated position, the trunk of the cross would
slide down my back into the hole. One or two of the
stones had been dislodged, but the cross was now helping
me, since its foot remained in place where I had
built up the wall. Finally, a pull on my back indicated
that the base was free. It was the final moment, just as at
the waterfall when I had had to fight my way through
the current: the most difficult moment, because it is
then that we fear failure and want to give up before it
occurs. Once again I sensed how absurd the task was,
trying to raise a cross when all I really wanted to do was
225
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 225
find my sword. But none of these thoughts was important.
With a sudden thrust, I raised my back, and the
cross slid into place. At that moment I recognized once
again that fate had been directing the work I had done.
I stood there expecting the cross to fall in the other
direction, scattering the stones I had placed. Then I
thought that maybe my push had not been strong
enough and that the cross was going to fall back on top
of me. But what I heard was the muffled sound of something
hitting against the bottom of the hole.
I turned carefully. The cross was upright, and it was
still trembling from the impact. Some stones were
rolling down their slope, but the cross was not going to
fall. I quickly put the stones back in place and embraced
the cross so that it would stop wavering. I felt alive and
hot, certain that the cross had been my friend throughout
all of my work. I stepped away slowly, improving
the placement of the stones with my feet.
I stood there admiring my work for a long time,
until my wounds began to hurt. Petrus was still asleep. I
went over to him and nudged him with my foot.
He awoke with a start and looked at the cross.
‘Very good,’ was all that he said. ‘In Ponferrada, we
will change the bandages.’
226
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 226
The Tradition
‘I would rather have lifted a tree. That cross on my back
had me thinking that my search for wisdom was going
to be the death of me.’
Looking at my surroundings, my words rang a bit
hollow. The cross episode was already history, as if it
had happened a long time ago and not just the previous
day. It had no relation to the black marble bathroom,
the warmth of the water in the hot tub, or the crystal
goblet of Rioja wine that I was enjoying. I could not see
Petrus, who was in his own bedroom in the luxury suite
we had rented in a first-class hotel.
‘Why the cross?’ I insisted.
‘It wasn’t easy to convince the man at the front desk
that you weren’t a beggar,’ he yelled from his room.
He was changing the subject, and I knew from experience
that it would do no good to press the matter. I
got up and put on trousers, a clean shirt, and fresh bandages.
I had removed the old ones very carefully, expecting
to find open wounds, but the scabs had only broken
away from the skin slightly and allowed some blood to
ooze out. A new scab had already formed, and I was
feeling restored and happy.
227
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 227
We had dinner at the hotel restaurant. Petrus asked
for the specialty of the house – a Valencia paella –
which we ate in silence. After dinner, he suggested a
walk.
We left the hotel and walked in the direction of the
railroad station. He was in his now-habitual laconic
state and said nothing throughout our entire stroll. We
came to a train yard, filthy and smelling of oil, and he
sat down on the steps of a gigantic locomotive.
‘Let’s stop here,’ he said.
I didn’t want to get oil stains on my pants, so I
decided to stand. I asked him if he wouldn’t prefer to
walk to the main square of Ponferrada.
‘The Road to Santiago is about to end,’ said my
guide, ‘and since our reality is a lot more similar to
these railroad cars, stinking of oil, than to the bucolic
retreats we have encountered during our journey, it is
better that today’s conversation happen here.’
Petrus told me to take off my sneakers and my shirt.
Then he loosened the bandages on my arms, leaving
them freer to move. But he left those on my hands as
they were.
‘Don’t worry,’ he said. ‘You are not going to need
your hands for this, at least not to hold anything.’
He was more serious than usual, and his tone of
voice surprised me. Something important was about to
happen.
Petrus sat down again on the steps of the locomotive
and looked at me for a long time. Then he said, ‘I am
228
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 228
not going to say anything about yesterday’s episode. You
will discover for yourself what it means, and this will
happen only if someday you decide to walk the Road to
Rome – the Road of the graces and miracles. I want to
tell you just one thing: people who consider themselves
to be wise are often indecisive when command is called
for and rebellious when they are called upon to obey.
They are ashamed to give orders and consider it dishonorable
to receive them. Don’t ever be that way.
‘In the room, you said that the path to wisdom leads
to sacrifice. That is wrong. Your learning period did not
end yesterday: you still have to find your sword and
learn its secret. The RAM practices allow us to engage in
the good fight and to have a better chance at winning in
life. The experience you had yesterday was only one of
the tests along the Road – it was part of the preparation
for the Road to Rome. It saddens me that you thought
that it might have been the death of you.’
He really sounded saddened. I realized that throughout
all the time we had spent together, I had always
expressed doubt regarding what he was teaching me. I
was not a strong, humble Castaneda receiving his teachings
from Don Juan; I was an arrogant and fractious
man in my approach to the simple RAM practices. I
wanted to say this to Petrus, but I knew that it was too
late.
‘Close your eyes,’ Petrus said. ‘Do the RAM Breathing
Exercise, and try to harmonize yourself with this iron,
this machinery, and this smell of oil. This is our world.
229
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 229
You should open your eyes only when I have completed
teaching you an exercise.’
I closed my eyes, concentrated on the RAM breathing,
and felt my body begin to relax. I could hear the
noises of the city, some dogs barking in the distance,
and the sound of voices in argument not far from where
we were. Suddenly, I began to hear Petrus’s voice singing
an Italian song recorded by Pepino Di Capri that had
been a hit when I was a teenager. I didn’t understand
the words, but the melody brought back happy memories
and helped me to reach a state of tranquillity.
‘Some time ago,’ he began, when he had stopped
singing, ‘as I was working on a project that I had to
deliver to the mayor’s office in Milan, I received a message
from my Master. Someone had gone all the way to
the end of the road of the Tradition and had not
received his sword. I was supposed to guide him along
the Road to Santiago.
‘I was not surprised at this: I had been expecting
such a summons at any time, because I had not yet
paid my dues. I had to guide a pilgrim along the
Milky Way, just as I had once been guided. But I was
nervous because it was the first and only time that I
would do this, and I did not know how to carry out
my mission.’
Petrus’s words really surprised me. I thought that he
had been a guide dozens of times.
‘You came here, and I guided you,’ he continued. ‘I
must confess that in the beginning it was very hard,
230
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 230
because you were much more interested in the intellectual
implications of the teachings than in the true
meaning of the Road – the Road of the common
people. After the encounter with Alfonso, we developed
a much stronger, more intense relationship, and I began
to believe that I would be able to teach you the secret of
your sword. But this did not happen, and now you will
have to learn it for yourself during the little time you
have left.’
This conversation was making me nervous, and I
was losing my concentration on the RAM Breathing
Exercise. Petrus must have noticed, because he began to
sing the song again and stopped only when I was once
again relaxed.
‘If you discover the secret and find your sword, you
will also discover the face of RAM, and you will have the
power. But that is not all: in order to achieve total
wisdom, you will have to walk the other three Roads,
including the secret one, and the secret Road will not be
revealed to you, even by someone who has walked it. I
am telling you this because we are going to see each
other only one more time.’
My heart stopped, and involuntarily, I opened my
eyes. Petrus was glowing with the kind of brilliance I
had only seen around my Master.
‘Close your eyes!’ he barked, and I immediately
obeyed. But I was very upset, and I could not concentrate
anymore. My guide started to sing the Italian song
again, and only after a while was I able to relax.
231

‘Tomorrow you are going to receive a note telling
you where I am. I will be at a group initiation, a ritual
of honor in the Tradition. It is a ritual in honor of all of
the men and women who, down through the centuries,
have helped to keep alive the flame of wisdom, of the
good fight, and of agape. You will not be able to speak
to me. The place where we will meet is secret. It is
bathed in the blood of all those who have walked the
road of the Tradition and who, even with their swords
sharpened, were unable to brighten the darkness. But
their sacrifice was not in vain, and the proof that it was
not is that, centuries later, those who have walked different
roads will be there to pay them tribute. This is
important, and you should never forget it: even if you
become a Master, you have to realize that your road is
only one of many that lead to God. Jesus once said, “In
my Father’s house, there are many mansions.”’
Petrus repeated that after tomorrow, I would not see
him again.
‘On some future day, you will receive a message
from me, asking you to lead someone along the Road to
Santiago, just as I have led you. Then you will be able to
experience the great secret of the journey – a secret that I
am going to reveal to you now, but only through words.
It is a secret that has to be experienced to be understood.’
There was a prolonged silence. I began to think that
he had changed his mind or that he had left the train
yard. I felt an enormous desire to open my eyes to see
232
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 232
what was happening, but I forced myself to concentrate
on the RAM breathing.
‘The secret is the following,’ Petrus said. ‘You can
learn only through teaching. We have been together
here on the Road to Santiago, but while you were learning
the practices, I learned the meaning of them. In
teaching you, I truly learned. By taking on the role of
guide, I was able to find my own true path.
‘If you succeed in finding your sword, you will have
to teach the Road to someone else. And only when that
happens – when you accept your role as a Master – will
you learn all the answers you have in your heart. Each of
us knows the answers, even before someone tells us
what they are. Life teaches us lessons every minute, and
the secret is to accept that only in our daily lives can we
show ourselves to be as wise as Solomon and as powerful
as Alexander the Great. But we become aware of this
only when we are forced to teach others and to participate
in adventures as extravagant as this one has been.’
I was hearing the most unexpected farewell in my life.
The person with whom I had had the most intense bond
was saying good-bye right there in midjourney – in an oilysmelling
train yard, with me forced to keep my eyes closed.
‘I don’t like saying good-bye,’ Petrus continued. ‘I am
Italian, and I am very emotional. But according to the
law of the Tradition, you must find your sword alone.
This is the only way that you will believe in your own
power. I have passed on to you everything that I have to
give. The only thing left is the Dance Exercise, which I
233
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 233
am going to teach you now; you should perform it
tomorrow at the ritual.’
He was silent for a while, and then he spoke:
‘May that which is glorified be glorified in the Lord.
You may open your eyes.’
Petrus was still sitting on the locomotive. I did not
want to say anything, because I am Brazilian and also
emotional. The mercury lamp providing us with light
began to flutter, and a train whistled in the distance,
announcing its next stop.
It was then that Petrus taught me the Dance Exercise.
‘One more thing,’ he said, looking deeply into my
eyes. ‘When I completed my pilgrimage, I painted a
beautiful, immense picture that depicted everything that
had happened to me here. This is the Road of the
common people, and you can do the same thing, if you
like. If you don’t know how to paint, write something,
or create a ballet. Then, regardless of where they are,
people will be able to walk the Jacobean route, the
Milky Way, the Strange Road to Santiago.’
The train that had sounded its whistle began to enter
the station. Petrus waved to me and disappeared
between the parked railroad cars. I stood there amid the
noise of brakes screeching on steel, trying to decipher
the mysterious Milky Way over my head, those stars that
had guided me here and that had silently watched over
the loneliness and destiny of all human beings.
Next day, there was just a note left in my room: 7:00
p.m. – CASTLE OF THE TEMPLARS.

The Dance Exercise
Relax. Close your eyes.
Recall the first songs you heard as a child. Begin
to sing them in your thoughts. Little by little, let a
certain part of your body – your feet, your stomach,
your hands, your head, and so on – but only one
part, begin to dance to the melody you are singing.
After five minutes, stop singing, and listen to
the sounds all around you. Compose an internal
melody based on them, and dance to it with your
whole body. Don’t think about anything in
particular, but try to memorize the images that
spontaneously appear.
The dance offers an almost-perfect means of
communication with the Infinite Intelligence.
This exercise should last fifteen minutes.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 235
I spent the rest of that afternoon walking around the
streets aimlessly. I crossed and recrossed the small city
of Ponferrada, looking from a distance at the castle on
the hill where I had been bidden to appear. The
Templars had always stirred my imagination, and the
castle in Ponferrada was not the only mark made on the
Jacobean route by their order. The order had been created
by nine knights who had decided not to return
from the Crusades. Within a short time, their power had
spread throughout Europe, and they had caused a revolution
in the values at the beginning of this millennium.
While most of the nobility of the time was
concerned only with enriching itself through the labor
of the serfs, the Knights Templar dedicated their lives,
their fortunes, and their swords to one cause only: the
protection of the pilgrims that walked the Road to
Jerusalem. In the behavior of the Knights, the pilgrims
found a model for their own search for wisdom.
In 1118, when Hugh de Payens and eight other
knights held a meeting in the courtyard of an old, abandoned
castle, they took a vow of love for all humanity.
Two centuries later, there were more than five thousand
benefices spread throughout the known world; they reconciled
two activities that until then had appeared to be
incompatible: the military life and the religious one.
Donations from the members and from grateful pilgrims
allowed the Order of the Knights Templars to
accumulate incalculable wealth, which was used more
than once to ransom important Christians who had
236
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 236
been kidnapped by the Muslims. The honesty of the
Knights was such that kings and nobles entrusted their
valuables to the Templars and traveled only with a document
that attested to the existence of their wealth. This
document could be redeemed at any castle of the Order
of the Templars for an equivalent sum, giving rise to the
letter of credit that is used today.
Their spiritual devotion, in turn, had allowed the
Knights Templars to understand the great truth that
Petrus had quoted the night before: that the house of
the Lord has many mansions. They sought to put an
end to religious conflict and to unite the main
monotheistic religions of the time: Christian, Jewish,
and Islamic. Their chapels were built with the rounded
cupola of the Judaic temples of Solomon, the octagonal
walls of the Arab mosques, and the naves that were typical
of Christian churches.
But as with everything that happens before its time,
the Templars came to be viewed with suspicion. The
great kings sought to hold economic power, and religious
liberalism was regarded as a threat to the Church.
On Friday, October 13, 1307, the Vatican and the major
European states unleashed one of the most massive
police operations of the Middle Ages: during the night,
the main leaders of the Templars were seized in their
castles and thrown in prison. They were accused of practicing
secret ceremonies, including the worship of the
devil, of blasphemy against Jesus Christ, of orgiastic rituals,
and of engaging in sodomy with their apprentices.
237
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 237
Following a violent sequence of torture, renunciation,
and treason, the Order of the Templars was erased from
the map of medieval history. Their treasures were confiscated,
and their members scattered throughout the
world. The last master of the Order, Jacques de Molay,
was burned at the stake in the center of Paris, along with
a fellow Knight. His last request was that he be allowed
‘to die looking at the towers of the Cathedral of Notre
Dame.’
Spain, which was struggling to recapture the Iberian
peninsula, welcomed the Knights fleeing from other
parts of Europe, and the Spanish kings sought their help
in the battles against the Moors. These Knights were
absorbed into the Spanish orders, one of which was the
Order of San Tiago of the Sword, responsible for protection
along the Road.
I was thinking about this history when, exactly at
seven in the evening, I passed through the main gate of
the old Castle of the Templars of Ponferrada, where I
was scheduled for an encounter with the Tradition.
There was no one there. I waited for half an hour
and then began to fear the worst: that the ritual must
have been at 7:00 a.m. But just as I was deciding to
leave, two boys appeared, carrying the flag of Holland
and with the scallop shell – the symbol of the Road to
Santiago – sewn to their clothing. They came up to me,
and we exchanged some words, concluding that we
were there for the same purpose. I was relieved that the
note had not been wrong.
238
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 238
Every fifteen minutes someone else arrived. There
were an Australian, five Spaniards, and another man
from Holland. Other than a few questions about the
schedule – about which everyone was confused – we
did not talk at all. We all sat together in the same part of
the castle – a ruined atrium that had served as a storeroom
for food in ancient times – and we decided to
wait until something happened, even if we had to wait
another day and night.
The waiting went on, and we fell to talking about
the reasons we were there. It was then that I learned that
the Road to Santiago is used by a number of different
orders, most of them part of the Tradition. The people
who were there had already been through many tests
and initiations of the kind that I had gone through long
ago in Brazil. Only the Australian and I were expecting
to be conferred the highest degree of the first Road.
Even without knowing the details, I could see that the
process the Australian had gone through was completely
different from the RAM practices.
At about 8:45, as we were beginning to talk about
our personal lives, a gong rang. We followed the sound
to the ancient chapel of the castle.
There we found an impressive scene. The chapel – or
what remained of it, since most of it was in ruins – was
illuminated only by torches. Where there had once been
an altar could be seen seven figures garbed in the secular
costumes of the Templars: a hood and steel helmet, a
coat of mail, a sword, and a shield. I gasped: it was a
239
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 239
scene from the distant past. All that made the situation
seem real were our own suits and jeans and our shirts
with the scallop shell emblem.
Even with the faint illumination provided by the
torches, I could see that one of the Knights was Petrus.
‘Approach your Masters,’ said the Knight who
appeared to be the oldest. ‘Look into the eyes of your
Master. Take off your clothes and receive your vestments.’
I went to Petrus and looked deeply into his eyes. He
was in a kind of trance and seemed not to recognize me.
But I could see in his eyes a certain sadness, the same
sadness that his voice had conveyed on the previous
night. I took all of my clothes off, and Petrus handed
me a perfumed black tunic that fell loosely around my
body. I surmised that one of the Masters had more than
one disciple, but I could not see which he was because
of the requirement that I keep my eyes fixed on those of
Petrus.
The High Priest directed us to the center of the
chapel, and two Knights began to trace a circle around
us as they chanted: ‘Trinitas, Sother, Messias,
Emmanuel, Sabahot, Adonai, Athanatos, Jesus …’*
240
Paulo Coelho
* Since this is an extremely long ritual and can be understood only
by those who know the road of the Tradition, I have opted to
summarize the incantations used. But this does not change the
narrative at all, since this ritual was performed only to establish a
reunion with and respect for the ancients. The important element
of this part of the Road to Santiago – the Dance Exercise –
is described here in its entirety.
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 240
The circle was being drawn to provide the protection
needed for those within it. I noticed that four of us had
white tunics, signifying vows of total chastity.
‘Amides, Throdonias, Anitor!’ intoned the High
Priest. ‘By the grace of the angels. Lord, I provide the
vestment of salvation; I pray that everything I desire be
transformed into reality, through thee, O my sacred
Adonai, whose kingdom is forever. Amen!’
The High Priest placed over his coat of mail the
white mantle with the Templar’s Cross outlined in red
in the center. The other Knights did the same.
It was exactly nine o’clock, the hour of Mercury, the
messenger. And there I was, once again within the circle
of the Tradition. There was an incense of mint, basil,
and benjamin burning in the chapel, and the grand
invocation of the Knights began:
‘O great and glorious King, who rules through the
power of the Supreme God, EL, over all higher and
lower spirits, but especially over the Infernal Order of
the Dominion of the East, I invoke you … so that I may
realize my wish, whatever that may be, so long as it is
proper to your labors, through the power of our God,
EL, who created and provided all things celestial, of the
air, of the earth, and of the infernal realm.’
A profound silence followed, and even without
being able to see him, we could sense the presence of
the being who had been the object of the invocation.
This was the consecration of the ritual, a propitious sign
that we should continue with our magical activities. I
241
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 241
had already participated in hundreds of similar ceremonies,
at some of which the results up to this point
had been much more surprising. But the Castle of the
Templars must have stimulated my imagination a little,
because I thought I saw, hovering in the corner of the
chapel, a kind of shining bird that I had never seen
before.
The High Priest sprinkled water over us without
stepping into the circle. Then, with the sacred ink, he
wrote in the earth the seventy-two names by which God
is known within the Tradition.
All of us – pilgrims and Knights – began to recite the
sacred names. The flames of the torches crackled, a sign
that the spirit that had been invoked had surrendered.
The moment for the dance had arrived. I knew how
to participate because Petrus had taught me on the previous
day; it was a different dance from the one I was
used to performing at this stage during similar rituals.
No rule was stated, but all of us already knew what it
was: no initiate could step outside the protective circle,
since we lacked the protection that the Knights had with
their suits of mail. I visualized the size of the circle and
did exactly as Petrus had taught me.
I thought back to my infancy. A voice, the far-off voice
of a woman within me, began to sing a simple melody. I
knelt and compressed myself into the seed position and
felt that my breast – only my breast – was beginning to
dance. I felt at ease, able to enter completely into the
ritual of the Tradition. The music within me began to
242
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 242
change; my movements became more pronounced, and I
entered into a powerful state of ecstasy. Everything
around me was darkened, and my body, surrounded by
that darkness, felt weightless. I saw myself walking
through the flowered fields of Aghata, where I met my
grandmother and an uncle who had been important to
me when I was a child. I felt the vibration of time in its
grid of quadrants, where all roads are joined and mixed,
becoming identical despite their being so different from
each other. At one point, I saw the Australian flash by me:
his body was suffused in a red glow.
The image that followed was of a chalice and paten,
and this image lasted for a long time, as if it had a special
importance for me. I tried to understand its significance,
but nothing came to me, despite my conviction
that it had something to do with my sword. Then, after
the chalice and paten had vanished, I saw the face of
RAM coming toward me out of the darkness. But when
the face came closer, it was only the face of N., the spirit
that had been invoked, who was well known to me. We
did not establish any special kind of communication,
and his face dissolved into the darkness that was fluctuating
around me.
I don’t know how long we continued to dance. But
suddenly I heard a voice:
‘YAHWEH, TETRAGRAMMATON …’ and I didn’t
want to emerge from my trance, but the voice insisted:
‘YAHWEH, TETRAGRAMMATON …’ and I recognized
the voice of the High Priest, calling upon
243
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 243
everyone to come out of the trance. It irritated me. The
Tradition was where I was rooted, and I did not want to
come back. But the Master demanded it:
‘YAHWEH, TETRAGRAMMATON …’
I couldn’t maintain the trance. Resentfully, I
returned to earth. I was once again within the magic
circle there in the ancestral ambiance of the Castle of
the Templars.
We pilgrims looked at each other. The sudden interruption
seemed to have displeased everyone. I felt a
strong urge to tell the Australian that I had seen him in
my trance. But when I looked over at him, I saw that it
wasn’t necessary: he had seen me, too.
The Knights came to us and surrounded us. They
began to beat upon their shields with their hands,
making a noise that was deafening. Then the High Priest
spoke:
‘O Spirit N., because thou so diligently responded to
my requests, with all due solemnity I allow thee to
depart, without injury to man or beast. Go, I command
thee, and be ready and anxious to return whenever thou
art duly exorcised and conjured by the sacred rites of the
Tradition. I conjure thee to go, peacefully and quietly,
and may God’s peace continue ever to be with thee and
me. Amen.’
The circle was erased, and we knelt with our heads
bowed. A Knight said seven Paternosters and seven Ave
Marias with us. The High Priest added seven repetitions
of the Apostles’ Creed, stating that Our Lady of
244
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 244
Medjugorje – whose visitations had been noted in
Yugoslavia ever since 1982 – had indicated that he
should do this. And then we began another of the
Christian rituals.
‘Andrew, rise and come before me,’ said the High
Priest. The Australian approached the altar, where the
seven Knights were standing.
One of the Knights – the one who must have been
his guide – spoke:
‘Brother, dost thou demand the company of the
House?’
‘Yes,’ answered the Australian. And then I understood
which of the Christian rituals we were witnessing:
the initiation of a Templar.
‘Dost thou understand the great severities of the
House and its charitable orders?’
‘I am ready to support all of them, in God’s name,
and I desire to be a servant and slave of the House forever,
through all the days of my life,’ answered the
Australian.
There followed a series of ritual questions, some of
which made no sense in today’s world; others were concerned
with profound devotion and love. Andrew, with
his head bowed, responded to all of them.
‘Distinguished brother, thou art asking a great thing
of me. But thou art seeing only the outer layer of our
religion – the beautiful horses and the elegant vestments,’
said his guide. ‘But thou knowest not the hard
demands made here within: it will be difficult for thee,
245
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 245
who art master of thyself, to serve others; rarely wilt
thou be able to do as thou wishest. If thou desirest that
thou be here, thou wilt be sent beyond the sea, and if
thou desirest that thou be in Acre, thou wilt be sent to
Tripoli, or Antioch, or Armenia. And when thou desirest
sleep, thou wilt be told to stand guard, and when thou
wantest to stand guard, thou wilt be told to sleep in thy
bed.’
‘I desire to enter the House,’ answered the Australian.
It felt as if all of the Templars who had ever lived in the
castle were happily attending the initiation ceremony;
the torches were crackling in earnest.
Several admonishments followed, and the
Australian answered them all by saying that he wanted
to enter the House. Finally, his guide turned to the High
Priest and repeated all of the answers the Australian had
made. The High Priest solemnly asked once more if he
was ready to accept all of the rules of the House.
‘Yes, Master, God willing. I come before God, before
thee, and before the brothers, and I implore and solicit
thee, before God and Our Lady, to take me into thy
company and into the favors of the House, spiritually
and temporally, as one who desires to be servant and
slave of the House from now on, for all the days of his
life.’
‘I bid you enter, by God’s love,’ said the High Priest.
With that, all of the Knights unsheathed their
swords and pointed them toward heaven. Then they
lowered the blades and made of them a crown of steel
246
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 246
around Andrew’s head. The flames created a golden
reflection on the blades, consecrating the moment.
Solemnly his Master came to him. And he gave him
his sword.
Someone began to toll a bell, and its notes echoed
off the walls of the ancient castle, infinitely repeating
themselves. We all bowed our heads, and the Knights
disappeared from view. When we looked up, we were
only ten; the Australian had left to join the Knights in
the ritual banquet.
We changed back into our street clothes and said our
good-byes without any further formalities. The dance
must have lasted for a long time, because the day was
brightening. An immense loneliness invaded my soul.
I was envious of the Australian, who had recovered
his sword and had reached the end of his quest. Now I
was alone, with no one to guide me; the Tradition – in a
distant country in South America – had expelled me
without showing me the road back. And I had to continue
to walk the Strange Road to Santiago, which was
now coming to an end, without knowing the secret of
my sword or how to find it.
The bell continued to toll. As I left the castle, with
dawn breaking, I noticed that it was the bell of a nearby
church, calling the faithful to the first mass of the day.
The people of the city were awakening to their work and
their unpaid bills, their love affairs and their dreams.
But they didn’t know that, on the previous night, an
ancestral rite had once again taken place, that what had
247
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 247
been thought of as dead and gone for centuries had
once again been celebrated, and that it continued to
demonstrate its awesome power.

El Cebrero
‘Are you a pilgrim?’ asked the little girl. She was the only
person in sight on that blazing afternoon in Villafranca
del Bierzo.
I looked at her but didn’t answer. She was about
eight and poorly dressed. She had run to the fountain
where I had sat down to rest.
My only concern now was to get to Santiago de
Compostela as quickly as possible and put an end to
this crazy adventure. I had not been able to forget the
sadness in Petrus’s voice at the train yard nor the way
he had looked at me from a distance when I had met
his gaze during the ritual of the Tradition. It was as if
all of the effort he had made in helping me had led
to nothing. When the Australian had been called to
the altar, I was sure that Petrus would have preferred
that it had been I who had been called. My sword
might very well be hidden in that castle, the repository
of legends and ancient wisdom. It was a place
that fit perfectly with all of my deductions: deserted,
visited only by a few pilgrims who respected the
relics of the Order of the Templars, and located on
sacred ground.
249
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 249
But only the Australian had been called to the altar.
And Petrus must have felt humiliated in the presence of
the others because, as a guide, he had not been capable
of leading me to my sword.
Besides this, the ritual of the Tradition had aroused
in me again a bit of my fascination with occult wisdom,
most of which I had forgotten about as I made my way
along the Strange Road to Santiago, the Road of the
common people. The invocations, the absolute control
over the material, the communication with other worlds
– all of that was much more interesting to me than the
RAM practices. But perhaps the practices had a more
objective application in my life; there was no doubt that
I had changed a lot since I had begun to walk the
Strange Road to Santiago. Thanks to Petrus’s help, I had
learned that I could pass through waterfalls, win out
over enemies, and converse with my messenger about
practical matters. I had seen the face of my death and
the blue sphere of the love that consumes and floods
the entire world. I was ready to fight the good fight and
turn my life into a series of triumphs.
Yet a hidden part of me was still nostalgic for the
magic circles, the transcendental formulas, the incense,
and the sacred ink. The ceremony that Petrus had
called an ‘homage to the ancients’ had been for me an
intense and healthful encounter with old, forgotten
lessons. And the possibility that I might never again
have access to that world discouraged me from wanting
to go on.
250
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 250
When I had returned to my hotel after the ritual of
the Tradition, there in my box, along with my key, was a
copy of The Pilgrim’s Guide. This was a book that Petrus
had utilized for orientation when the yellow markers
were hard to find; it had helped us to calculate the distances
between cities. I left Ponferrada that same morning,
without having slept, and went out on the Road. By
that afternoon, I had discovered that the map was not
drawn to scale, and that I had to spend a night out in
the open, in a cave in the cliffs.
There, as I meditated on everything that had happened
to me since my meeting with Mme Lourdes, I
thought about the relentless effort Petrus had made to
help me understand that contrary to what we had
always been taught, results were what counted. One’s
efforts are salutary and indispensable, but without
results, they amount to nothing. And now the only
result that I demanded of myself, the only reward for
everything I had been through, was to find my sword.
That had not happened yet, and Santiago was only a
few days away.
‘If you are a pilgrim, I can take you to the Gates of
Forgiveness,’ insisted the girl at the fountain in
Villafranca del Bierzo. ‘Whoever passes through those
gates need not go all the way to Santiago.’
I held out some pesetas to her so that she would go
away and leave me alone. But instead she began to
splash the water in the fountain, wetting my knapsack
and my shorts.
251
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 251
‘Come on, come on,’ she said again. At that moment,
I was thinking about one of Petrus’s repeated quotations:
‘He that ploweth should plow in hope. He that
thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.’ It was
from one of the letters of the apostle Paul.
I had to persevere for a little longer, to continue
searching until the end, without being fearful of defeat,
to keep alive the hope of finding my sword and understanding
its secret.
And – who knows? – was this little girl trying to tell
me something that I didn’t want to understand? If the
Gates of Forgiveness, which were part of a church, had
the same spiritual effect as arriving at Santiago, why
couldn’t my sword be there?
‘Let’s go,’ I said to the child. I looked at the mountain
that I had just descended; I was going to have to
climb part of it again. I had passed by the Gates of
Forgiveness with no desire to go to them, since my only
goal was to get to Santiago. Now, here was a little girl,
the only human being present there on that hot afternoon,
insisting that I go back and see something I had
decided to ignore. After all, why hadn’t that little girl
gone away after I had given her some money? Could it
be that, in my discouragement and haste, I had walked
right past my objective without recognizing it?
Petrus had always said that I liked to fantasize too
much about things. But perhaps he was wrong.
As I walked along with the girl, I was remembering
the story of the Gates of Forgiveness. They represented a
252
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 252
kind of ‘arrangement’ that the Church had made for pilgrims
who fell sick. From that point on, the Road
became once again difficult and mountainous all the
way to Compostela, so during the twelfth century, one
of the popes had said that whoever was unable to go
further had only to pass through the Gates of
Forgiveness to receive the same indulgences as the pilgrims
who made it to the end of the Road. With one
magic gesture, that pope had resolved the problem
posed by the mountains and had inspired an increased
number of pilgrimages.
We climbed, following the same route I had traveled
earlier in the day: twisting roads, slippery and steep. The
girl led, moving along very quickly, and many times I
had to ask that she go more slowly. She would do so for
a while and then, losing her sense of pace, would begin
to run again. Half an hour later, and after much grumbling
on my part, we reached the Gates of Forgiveness.
‘I have the key to the church,’ she said. ‘I will go in
and open the gates so you can pass through them.’
She went in through the main entrance, and I waited
outside. It was a small church, and the gates opened to
the north. The door frame was decorated with scallop
shells and scenes from the life of San Tiago. As I heard
the sound of the key in the lock, an immense German
shepherd, appearing out of nowhere, came up to me
and stood between the portal and me.
I was immediately prepared for a fight. ‘Not again,’ I
thought. ‘Is this story never going to end? Nothing but
253
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 253
more and more tests, battles, and humiliations – and
still no clue about my sword.’
At that moment, though, the Gates of Forgiveness
swung open, and the girl appeared. When she saw that
the dog was watching me – and that my eyes were
already fixed on his – she said some affectionate words
to him, and the dog relaxed. Wagging his tail, he followed
her toward the back of the church.
Maybe Petrus was right. Maybe I did like to fantasize
about things. A simple German shepherd had been
transformed in my mind into a threatening supernatural
being. That was a bad sign – a sign of the fatigue
that leads to defeat.
But there was still hope. The girl signaled to me to
enter. With my heart full of expectation, I passed through
the Gates of Forgiveness, thereby receiving the same indulgences
as the pilgrims who went all the way to Santiago.
My gaze swept over the empty, undecorated church,
seeking the only thing I cared about.
‘At the top of all the columns you can see shells. The
shell is the symbol of the Road,’ began the girl. ‘This is
Santa Agueda of …’
Before long, I could see that it had been useless to
come all the way back to this church.
‘And this is San Tiago Matamoros, brandishing his
sword. You can see dead Moors under his horse’s
hooves. This statue was made in …’
San Tiago’s sword was there but not mine. I offered a
few more pesetas to the girl, but she would not accept
254
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 254
them. A bit offended, she ended her explanations about
the church and asked me to leave.
Once again I walked down the mountain and
resumed my pilgrimage toward Compostela. As I passed
through Villafranca del Bierzo for the second time, a
man approached me. He said that his name was Angel
and asked if I would be interested in seeing the Church
of Saint Joseph the Carpenter. The man’s name gave me
hope, but I had just been disappointed, and I was
beginning to see that Petrus was an expert observer of
behavior. People do have a tendency to fantasize about
things that do not even exist, while they fail to learn the
lessons that are before their very eyes.
But perhaps just to confirm this tendency one more
time, I allowed myself to be led by Angel to this other
church. It was closed, and he did not have a key. He
pointed to the framework of the entrance with its carving
of Saint Joseph, his carpentry tools close alongside
him. I nodded, thanked him, and offered him some
pesetas. He refused them and left me there in the
middle of the street – but not before saying, ‘We are
proud of our city. It is not for money that we do this.’
I returned to the Road and in fifteen minutes had
left Villafranca del Bierzo behind – Villafranca del
Bierzo, with its doors, its streets, and its mysterious
guides who asked nothing in exchange for their services.
I walked for some time through mountainous terrain;
my progress was slow and demanding. As I
started out, I thought only about my previous worries
255
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 255
– solitude, shame at having disappointed Petrus, my
sword and its secret. But soon the images of the little
girl and of Angel began insistently to come to mind.
While I had been focusing only on what I would gain,
they had done the best for me that they could. And
they had asked for nothing in return. A vague idea
began to surface from deep inside me. It was some sort
of link among all the things I was thinking about.
Petrus had always insisted that the expectation of
reward was absolutely necessary to the achievement of
victory. Yet every time that I forgot about the rest of
the world and began to think only about my sword, he
forced me, through his painful lessons, to return to
reality. This was a sequence that had occurred repeatedly
during our time together on the Road.
There was some reason for this, and it was somehow
connected with the secret of my sword. What was
hiding there inside me began to coalesce and come to
light. I still was not sure what it was that I was thinking,
but something told me that I was looking in the right
direction.
I appreciated having run into the little girl and Angel;
they had shown something of the love that consumes in
the way they spoke about their churches. They had
caused me to go over the same ground twice, and because
of this, I had forgotten my fascination with the ritual of
the Tradition and had returned to the fields of Spain.
I remembered a day long ago when Petrus had told
me that we had walked several times over the same part
256
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 256
of the Road in the Pyrenees. I remembered that day with
nostalgia. It had been a good beginning, and who knew
but what this repetition of that event was not an omen
of a positive outcome.
That night I arrived at a village and asked for a room
at the home of an old lady. She charged me a pittance
for my bed and food. We chatted a bit, and she talked
about her faith in Jesus of the Sacred Heart and her worries
about the olive crop in that drought year. I drank
some wine, had some soup, and went to bed early.
I was feeling better about things, mainly because of
the concept that was developing in my mind and the
fact that it felt ready for expression. I prayed, did some
of Petrus’s exercises, and decided to invoke Astrain.
I needed to talk to him about what had happened
during the fight with the dog. That day he had almost
caused me to lose, and then, after his refusal in the
episode of the cross, I had decided to do away with him
forever. On the other hand, if I had not recognized his
voice during the fight, I would have given in to the
temptations that had appeared.
‘You did everything possible to help Legion win,’ I
said.
‘I do not fight against my brothers,’ Astrain answered.
It was the response I had expected. I had already predicted
that he would say this, and it didn’t make sense to
get irritated with the messenger for being himself. I had
to seek out in him the ally who had helped me at times
like this, for that was his only function. I put my rancor
257
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 257
aside and began to tell him animatedly about the Road,
about Petrus, and about the secret of the sword, which I
felt was beginning to formulate itself in my mind. He
had nothing important to say – only that these secrets
were not available to him. But at least I had someone to
open up with after having spent the entire afternoon in
silence. We had been talking for hours when the old lady
rapped on my door to tell me that I was talking in my
sleep.
I awoke feeling more optimistic and took to the
Road early. According to my calculations, that afternoon
I would reach Galicia, the region where Santiago de
Compostela was located. It was all uphill, and I had to
exert myself for almost four hours to keep to the pace I
had set for myself. Every time I reached the crest of a hill
I hoped that it would mark the point of descent. But
this never seemed to happen, and I had to give up any
hope of moving along more rapidly. In the distance I
could see mountains that were even higher, and I realized
that sooner or later I was going to have to cross
them. My physical exertions, meanwhile, had made it
impossible to think much, and I began to feel more
friendly toward myself.
‘Come on now, after all, how can you take seriously
anyone who leaves everything behind to look for a
sword?’ I asked myself. What would it really mean to my
life if I couldn’t find it? I had learned the RAM practices,
I had gotten to know my messenger, fought with the
dog, and seen my death, I told myself, trying to convince
258
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 258
myself that the Road to Santiago was what was important
to me. The sword was only an outcome. I would like
to find it, but I would like even more to know what to
do with it. Because I would have to use it in some practical
way, just as I used the exercises Petrus had taught me.
I stopped short. The thought that up until then had
been only nascent exploded into clarity. Everything
became clear, and a tide of agape washed over me. I
wished with all my heart that Petrus were there so that I
could tell him what he had been waiting to hear from
me. It was the only thing that he had really wanted me
to understand, the crowning accomplishment of all the
hours he had devoted to teaching me as we walked the
Strange Road to Santiago: it was the secret of my sword!
And the secret of my sword, like the secret of any
conquest we make in our lives, was the simplest thing in
the world: it was what I should do with the sword.
I had never thought in these terms. Throughout our
time on the Strange Road to Santiago, the only thing I
had wanted to know was where it was hidden. I had
never asked myself why I wanted to find it or what I
needed it for. All of my efforts had been bent on reward;
I had not understood that when we want something, we
have to have a clear purpose in mind for the thing that
we want. The only reason for seeking a reward is to
know what to do with that reward. And this was the
secret of my sword.
Petrus needed to know that I had learned this, but I
was sure I would never see him again. He had waited so
259
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 259
long for this, and he would never know that it had happened.
So I knelt there, took some paper from my notebook,
and wrote down what I intended to do with my
sword. I folded the sheet carefully and placed it under a
stone – one that reminded me of him and his friendship.
Time would eventually destroy the paper, but symbolically,
I was delivering it to Petrus.
Now he knew that I was going to succeed with my
sword. My mission with Petrus had been accomplished.
I climbed the mountain, and the agape flowing
through me intensified the colors in the surroundings.
Now that I had discovered the secret, I had to find what
I was looking for. A faith, an unshakable certainty, took
control of my being. I began to sing the Italian song
that Petrus had remembered in the train yard. I didn’t
know the words, so I made them up. There was no one
in sight, and I was passing through some deep woods,
so the isolation made me sing even louder. Shortly I saw
that the words I had used made a kind of absurd sense.
They were a way of communicating with the world that
only I knew, since now it was the world that was teaching
me.
I had experimented with this in a different way during
my first encounter with Legion. That day, the gift of
tongues had manifested itself in me. I had been the servant
of the Spirit, which had used me to save a woman
and to create an enemy, and had taught me the cruel version
of the good fight. Now everything was different: I
260
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 260
was my own Master, and I was learning to communicate
with the universe.
I began to talk to everything along the Road: tree
trunks, puddles, fallen leaves, and beautiful vines. It was
an exercise of the common people, learned by children
and forgotten by adults. And I received a mysterious
response from those things, as if they understood what I
was saying; they, in turn, flooded me with the love that
consumes. I went into a kind of trance that frightened
me, but I wanted to continue the game until I tired of it.
Petrus was right again: by teaching myself, I had
transformed myself into a Master.
It was time for lunch, but I didn’t stop to eat. When I
passed through the small villages along the Road, I
spoke more softly and smiled to myself, and if by
chance someone noticed me, they would have concluded
that the pilgrims arriving nowadays at the
Cathedral of Santiago were crazy. But this didn’t matter
to me, because I was celebrating the life all around me
and because I knew what I had to do with my sword
when I found it.
For the rest of the afternoon, I walked along in a
trance, aware of where it was that I wanted to go but
more aware of my surroundings and the fact that they
had returned agape to me. Heavy clouds began to gather
in the sky for the first time in my journey, and I hoped it
would rain. After such a long period of hiking and of
drought, the rain would be a new, exciting experience.
At three in the afternoon, I crossed into Galicia, and I
261
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 261
could see on the map that there was one more mountain
to climb in order to complete that leg of the pilgrimage.
I was determined to climb it and then to sleep
in the first town on the other side: Tricastela, where a
great king – Alfonso IX – had dreamed of creating an
immense city but which, many centuries later, was still a
tiny country village.
Still singing and speaking the language I had
invented for communicating with the things around
me, I began to climb the only remaining mountain: El
Cebrero. Its name went back to ancient Roman settlements
in the region and was said to mean ‘February,’
when something important had presumably happened.
In ancient times, this was considered to be the most difficult
part of the Jacobean route, but today things have
changed. Although the angle of ascent is steeper than in
the other mountains, a large television antenna on a
neighboring mountain serves as a reference point for
pilgrims and prevents their wandering from the Road, a
common and fatal event in the past.
The clouds began to lower, and I saw that I would
shortly be entering fog. To get to Tricastela, I had to
follow the yellow markers carefully; the television
antenna was already hidden in the mist. If I got lost, I
would wind up sleeping outdoors, and on that day, with
the threat of rain, the experience would be quite disagreeable.
It is one thing to feel raindrops falling on
your face, enjoying the freedom of the life of the Road,
and then find a place nearby where you can have a glass
262
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 262
of wine and sleep in a bed in preparation for the next
day’s march. It is quite another to have the raindrops
cause a night of insomnia as you try to sleep in the
mud, with your wet bandages providing fertile ground
for a knee infection.
I had to decide quickly. Either I went forward
through the fog – there was still enough light to do so –
or I returned to sleep in the small village I had passed
through a few hours ago, leaving the crossing of El
Cebrero for the next day.
As I realized that I had to make a quick decision, I
noticed that something strange was happening. My certainty
that I had discovered the secret of my sword was
somehow pushing me to go forward into the fog that
would shortly engulf me. This feeling was quite different
from the one that had made me follow the little girl
to the Gates of Forgiveness and made me go with the
man to the Church of Saint Joseph the Carpenter.
I remembered that, on the few occasions when I had
agreed to put a magic curse on someone in Brazil, I had
compared this mystical experience with another very
common experience: that of learning to ride a bicycle.
You begin by mounting the bicycle, pushing on the
pedals, and falling. You try and you fall, try and fall, and
you cannot seem to learn how to balance yourself.
Suddenly, though, you achieve perfect equilibrium, and
you establish complete mastery over the vehicle. It is
not a cumulative experience but a kind of ‘miracle’ that
manifests itself only when you allow the bicycle ‘to ride
263
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 263
you.’ That is, you accept the disequilibrium of the two
wheels and, as you go along, begin to convert the initial
force toward falling into a greater force on the pedal.
At that moment in my ascent of El Cebrero, at four
in the afternoon, I saw that the same miracle had
occurred. After so much time spent walking the Road to
Santiago, the Road to Santiago began to ‘walk me.’ I followed
what everyone calls one’s intuition. And because
of the love that consumes that I had experienced all that
day, and because my sword’s secret had been discovered,
and because at moments of crisis a person always makes
the right decision, I went forward with no hesitation
into the fog.
‘This fog has to stop,’ I thought, as I struggled to see
the yellow markers on the stones and trees along the
Road. By now the visibility had been very poor for
almost an hour, but I continued to sing as an antidote
to my fear, while I hoped that something extraordinary
would happen. Surrounded by the fog, alone in those
unreal surroundings, I began to look at the Road to
Santiago as if it were a film; this was the moment when
the hero does things that no one else in the film would
dare to do, while the audience is thinking that such
things only happen in the movies. But there I was, living
through a real situation. The forest was growing quieter
and quieter, and the fog began to dissipate. I seemed to
be reaching the end of the obscurity, but the light confused
me and bathed everything in mysterious, frightening
colors.
264
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 264
The silence was now complete, and as I noticed this,
I heard, coming from my left, a woman’s voice. I
stopped immediately, expecting to hear it again, but I
heard nothing – not even the normal sounds of the
forest, with its crickets, its insects, and its animals walking
through the dry leaves. I looked at my watch: it was
exactly 5:15 p.m. I estimated that I was still about three
miles from Tricastela and that there was still time to
arrive before dark.
As I looked up from my watch, I heard the woman’s
voice again. And from that point on, I was to live
through one of the most significant experiences of my
life.
The voice wasn’t coming from somewhere in the
woods but from somewhere inside me. I was able to
hear it clearly, and it heightened my intuitive sense. It
was neither I nor Astrain who was speaking. The voice
only told me that I should keep on walking, which I did
unquestioningly. It was as if Petrus had returned and
was telling me again about giving orders and taking
them. At that moment, I was simply an instrument of
the Road; the Road was indeed ‘walking me.’ The fog
grew less and less dense; I seemed to be walking out of
it. Around me were the bare trees, the moist and slippery
terrain, and ahead of me, the same steep slope I
had been climbing for such a long time.
Suddenly, as if by magic, the fog lifted completely.
And there before me, driven into the crest of the mountain,
was a cross.
265
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 265
I looked around, and I could see both the fog bank
from which I had emerged and another above me.
Between the two, I could see the peaks of the tallest
mountains and the top of El Cebrero, where the cross
was. I felt a strong desire to pray. Even though I knew
that I would have to detour from the road to Tricastela, I
decided to climb to the peak and say my prayers at the
foot of the cross. It took forty minutes to make the
climb, and I did it in complete silence, within and without.
The language I had invented was forgotten; it was
not the right language for communicating with other
people or with God. The Road to Santiago was ‘walking
me,’ and it was going to show me where my sword was.
Petrus was right again.
When I reached the peak, a man was sitting there,
writing something. For an instant I thought he was a
supernatural being, sent from elsewhere. Then my intuition
told me that he was not, and I saw the scallop
shell stitched into his clothing; he was just a pilgrim,
who looked at me for a few moments and then walked
away, disturbed by my having appeared. Perhaps he had
been expecting the same thing as I – an angel – and we
had each found just another person on the Road of the
common people.
Although I wanted to pray, I wasn’t able to say anything.
I stood in front of the cross for some time, looking
at the mountains and at the clouds that covered the
sky and the land, leaving only the high peaks clear.
Thirty yards below me there was a hamlet with fifteen
266
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 266
houses and a small church, whose lights were being
turned on. At least I had somewhere to spend the night
if the Road told me to do so. I was not sure when it
would tell me, but even with Petrus gone, I was not
without a guide. The Road was ‘walking me.’
An unfettered lamb, climbing the mountain,
stopped between the cross and me. He looked at me, a
bit frightened. For some time I stood there, looking at
the black sky, and the cross, and the white lamb at its
foot. All at once, I felt exhausted by all that time spent
on tests and battles and lessons and the pilgrimage. I
felt a terrible pain in my stomach, and it rose to my
throat, where it was transformed into dry, tearless sobs.
There I stood, overcome by the scene of the lamb and
the cross. This was a cross that I need not set upright, for
it was there before me, solitary and immense, resisting
time and the elements. It was a symbol of the fate that
people created, not for their God but for themselves.
The lessons of the Road to Santiago came back to me as
I sobbed there, with a frightened lamb as my witness.
‘My Lord,’ I said, finally able to pray, ‘I am not nailed
to this cross, nor do I see you there. The cross is empty,
and that is how it should stay forever; the time of death
is already past, and a god is now reborn within me. This
cross is the symbol of the infinite power that each of us
has. Now this power is reborn, the world is saved, and I
am able to perform your miracles, because I trod the
Road of the common people and, in mingling with
them, found your secret. You came among us to teach
267
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 267
us all that we were capable of becoming, and we did not
want to accept this. You showed us that the power and
the glory were within every person’s reach, and this
sudden vision of our capacity was too much for us. We
crucified you, not because we were ungrateful to the
Son of God but because we were fearful of accepting our
own capacity. We crucified you fearing that we might be
transformed into gods. With time and tradition, you
came to be just a distant divinity, and we returned to
our destiny as human beings.
‘It is not a sin to be happy. Half a dozen exercises
and an attentive ear are enough to allow us to realize
our most impossible dreams. Because of my pride in
wisdom, you made me walk the Road that every person
can walk, and discover what everyone else already
knows if they have paid the slightest attention to life.
You made me see that the search for happiness is a personal
search and not a model we can pass on to others.
Before finding my sword, I had to discover its secret –
and the secret was so simple; it was to know what to do
with it. With it and with the happiness that it would
represent to me.
‘I have walked so many miles to discover things I
already knew, things that all of us know but that are so
hard to accept. Is there anything harder for us, my Lord,
than discovering that we can achieve the power? This
pain that I feel now in my breast, that makes me sob
and that frightens that poor lamb, has been felt since
human beings first existed. Few can accept the burden
268
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 268
of their own victory: most give up their dreams when
they see that they can be realized. They refuse to fight
the good fight because they do not know what to do
with their own happiness; they are imprisoned by the
things of the world. Just as I have been, who wanted to
find my sword without knowing what to do with it.’
A god sleeping within me was awakening, and the
pain was growing worse and worse. I felt the presence
close to me of my Master, and I was able for the first
time to turn my sobs into tears. I wept with gratitude for
his having made me search for my sword along the
Road to Santiago. I wept with gratitude for Petrus, for
his having taught me, without saying a word, that I
would realize my dreams if I first discovered what I
wanted to do with them. I saw the cross, with no one on
it, and the lamb at its base, free to go where he wanted
in those mountains and to see the clouds above his
head and below his feet.
The lamb began to walk away, and I followed him. I
already knew where he would lead me; in spite of the
clouds, everything had become clear to me. Even if I
could not see the Milky Way in the sky, I was certain
that it was there, pointing the way along the Road to
Santiago. I followed the lamb as he walked in the direction
of the hamlet – which was called El Cebrero, like
the mountain.
There, at one time, a miracle had happened. It was
the miracle of transforming what you do into what you
believe in, just like the secret of my sword and of the
269
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 269
Strange Road to Santiago. As we descended the mountain,
I remembered the story. A farmer from a nearby
village had climbed the mountain to attend mass at El
Cebrero on a stormy day. The mass was being celebrated
by a monk who was almost completely lacking in faith
and who ridiculed the farmer for having made such an
effort to get there. But at the moment of consecration,
the host had actually been transformed into the body of
Christ and the wine into his blood. The relics are still
there, guarded in that small chapel, a treasure greater
than all the riches of the Vatican.
The lamb stopped at the edge of the hamlet, where
there was only one street leading to the church. At that
moment, I was seized by a terrible fear, and I began to
repeat over and over, ‘Lord, I am not worthy to enter thy
house.’ But the lamb looked at me and spoke to me
through his eyes. He said that I should forget forever my
unworthiness because the power had been reborn in
me, in the same way that it could be reborn in all
people who devoted their lives to the good fight. A day
would come – said the lamb’s eyes – when people
would once again take pride in themselves, and then all
of nature would praise the awakening of the God that
had been sleeping within them.
As the lamb looked at me, I could read all of this in
his eyes; now he had become my guide along the Road
to Santiago. For a moment everything went dark, and I
began to see scenes that were reminiscent of those I had
read about in the Apocalypse: the Great Lamb on his
270
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 270
throne and people washing his vestments, cleansing
them with his blood. This was the moment when the
God was awakened in each of them. I also saw the wars
and hard times and catastrophes that were going to
shake the earth over the next few years. But everything
ended with the victory of the Lamb and with every
human being on earth awakening the sleeping God and
all of God’s power.
I followed the lamb to the small chapel built by the
farmer and by the monk who had come to believe in
what he did. Nobody knows who they were. Two nameless
tombstones in the cemetery by the chapel mark the
place where they were buried. But it is impossible to tell
which is the grave of the monk and which of the farmer.
The miracle had occurred because both had fought the
good fight.
The chapel was completely lit when I came to its
door. Yes, I was worthy of entering, because I had a
sword and I knew what to do with it. These were not the
Gates of Forgiveness, because I had already been forgiven
and had washed my clothing in the blood of the
Lamb. Now I wanted only to hold my sword and go out
to fight the good fight.
In the small church there was no cross. There on the
altar were the relics of the miracle: the chalice and the
paten that I had seen during the dance, and a silver reliquary
containing the body and blood of Jesus. I once
again believed in miracles and in the impossible things
that human beings can accomplish in their daily lives.
271
The Pilgrimage
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 271
The mountain peaks seemed to say to me that they were
there only as a challenge to humans – and that humans
exist only to accept the honor of that challenge.
The lamb slipped into one of the pews, and I looked
to the front of the chapel. Standing before the altar,
smiling – and perhaps a bit relieved – was my Master:
with my sword in his hand.
I stopped, and he came toward me, passing me by
and going outside. I followed him. In front of the
chapel, looking up at the dark sky, he unsheathed my
sword and told me to grasp its hilt with him. He
pointed the blade upward and said the sacred Psalm of
those who travel far to achieve victory:
A thousand fall at your side, and ten thousand to your right,
but you will not be touched.
No evil will befall you, no curse will fall upon your tent;
your angels will be given orders regarding you,
to protect you along your every way.
I knelt, and as he touched the blade to my shoulders, he
said:
Trample the lion and the serpent,
The lion cub and the dragon will make shoes for your feet.
As he finished saying this, it began to rain. The rain fertilized
the earth, and its water would return to the sky
after having given birth to a seed, grown a tree, brought
272
Paulo Coelho
The Pilgrimage 5/13/05 3:41 PM Page 272
a flower into blossom. The storm intensified, and I
raised my head, feeling the rain for the first time in my
entire journey along the Road to Santiago. I remembered
the dry fields, and I was joyful that they were
being showered upon that night. I remembered the
rocks in Leon, the wheat fields of Navarra, the dryness
of Castile, and the vineyards of Rioja that today were
drinking the rain that fell in torrents, with all of the
force in the skies. I remembered having raised a cross,
and I thought that the storm would once again cause it
to fall to earth so that another pilgrim could learn about
command and obedience. I thought of the waterfall,
which now must be even stronger because of the rainfall,
and of Foncebadon, where I had left such power to
fertilize the soil again. I thought about all of the water I
had drunk from so many fountains that were now being
replenished. I was worthy of my sword because I knew
what to do with it.
The Master held out the sword to me, and I grasped
it. I looked about for the lamb, but he had disappeared.
But that did not matter: the Water of Life fell from the
sky and caused the blade of my sword to glisten.

Epilogue:
Santiago de Compostela
From the window of my hotel I can see the Cathedral of
Santiago and the tourists at its main gate. Students in
black medieval clothing mingle with the townspeople,
and the souvenir vendors are setting up their stalls. It is
early in the morning, and except for my notes, these are
the first lines I have written about the Road to Santiago.
I reached the city yesterday, after having caught the
bus that runs from Pedrafita, near El Cebrero, to
Compostela. In four hours we covered the 150 kilometers
that separate the two cities, and this reminded me
of the journey with Petrus. At times, it took us two
weeks to cover that distance. In a short while, I am
going to the tomb of San Tiago to leave there the image
of Our Lady of the Visitation, mounted on the scallop
shells. Then, as soon as possible, I am going to catch a
plane for Brazil, because I have a lot to do. I remember
that Petrus told me once that he had condensed all of
his experience into one picture, and the thought occurs
to me that I might write a book about everything that
has happened to me. But this is still a remote idea; I
have so much to do now that I have recovered my
sword.

The secret of my sword is mine, and I will never
reveal it to anyone. I wrote it down and left it under a
stone, but with the rain, the paper has probably been
destroyed. It’s better that way. Petrus didn’t need to
know.
I asked my Master whether he had known what day I
was going to arrive or whether he had been waiting
there for some time. He laughed and said that he had
arrived there the morning before and was going to leave
the next day, whether I appeared or not.
I asked how that was possible, and he did not
answer me. But when we were saying good-bye and he
was getting into the rental car that would take him back
to Madrid, he gave me a small medal of the Order of
San Tiago of the Sword. And he told me that I had
already had a great revelation when I had looked into
the eyes of the lamb.
And when I think about it, I guess it is true that
people always arrive at the right moment at the place
where someone awaits them.

The Alchemist
Every few decades a book is published that changes the
lives of its readers forever. Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist is
such a book. With over 30 million copies sold worldwide,
The Alchemist has already achieved the status of a modern
classic.
This is the story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd
boy who dreams of travelling the world in search of a treasure
as extravagant as any ever found. From his home in
Spain he journeys to the exotic markets of Tangiers and
then into the Egyptian desert, where a fateful encounter
with the alchemist awaits him.
The Alchemist is a transforming novel about the essential
wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read the
omens strewn along life’s path and, above all, following
our dreams.
The Fifth Mountain
Fleeing his home from persecution, 23-year-old Elijah
takes refuge with a young widow and her son in the beautiful
town of Akbar. Already struggling to maintain his sanity
in a chaotic world of tyranny and war, he is now forced to
choose between his new-found love and his overwhelming
sense of duty.
Evoking all the drama and intrigue of the colourful,
chaotic world of the Middle East, Paulo Coelho turns the
trials of Elijah into an intensely moving and inspiring story
– one that powerfully brings out the universal themes of
how faith and love can ultimately triumph over suffering.

clearly and to understand why she had felt her life had no

even sexual awakening. Against all odds, she finds she is
falling in love and wanting, if at all possible, to live again …

The Devil and Miss Prym
A stranger arrives in the small mountain village of Viscos,
carrying with him a backpack containing a notebook and

good or evil? In welcoming the mysterious foreigner, the
whole village become accomplices to his sophisticated
plot, which will forever mark their lives.
In this stunning novel, Paulo Coelho’s unusual protagonist

capacity to choose between them.

confront and overcome his dark past. The Valkyries is a
compelling account of this journey, which takes him, with
his wife Chris, on a forty-day quest into the searing heat of
the Mojave Desert.
At once a modern-day adventure, a metaphysical battle
with self-doubt and fear and a true story of two people
striving to understand one another, The Valkyries is ultimately
a story about forgiving our past and believing our
future.

Eleven Minutes
‘Love is a terrible thing that will make you suffer …’
So says Maria, a Brazilian girl convinced from an early
age that she will never find true love. A chance meeting in
Rio takes her to Geneva, but the glittering life she hoped
for was a fantasy. The reality – selling herself to survive – is
a dehumanizing grind that pushes her further away from
real love, towards a fascination with pure physical pleasure.
But when her emotional barriers are tested by a handsome
young painter, she must choose between the dark
path she is on and risking everything to find her ‘inner
light’. Can she move beyond the meeting of bodies to a
meeting of minds or even souls – to a place where sex itself
is sacred?
Manual of the
Warrior of Light
Manual of the Warrior of Light is an invitation to each of us
to live our dream, to embrace the uncertainty of life and to
rise to meet our own unique destiny. In his inimitable
style, Paulo Coelho helps us to discover the warrior of light
within each of us.
With inspiring short passages, we are invited to embark
upon the way of the warrior: the one who appreciates the
miracle of being alive, the one who accepts failure, and the
one whose quest leads him to become the person he wants
to be.
